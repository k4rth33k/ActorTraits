0,Aamir Khan,"The journey that I have undertaken, meeting people from all walks of life and learning from them, has been my biggest achievement.I have had unsuccessful films, but I learned a lot from those films. I give my failures as much importance as my success.When I was new, I didn't know where my career will go. Initially, my films were not even successful, but then I learned a lot from my mistakes.I do what I feel is right. I am not scared to walk on the new path and take risk.I am happy that I have entertained people and made them happy.When I am shooting a film, then everything goes soft focus. My family also complains that I don't give them time.There must be a story within him/her that wants to come out. That's the reason why 'Dil Chahta Hai,' 'Lagaan,' and 'Rang De Basanti' worked so well: Ashutosh, Farhan, and Rakesh had a story inside them. It's very important that the director should have the fire in the belly to tell the story.I don't believe in strategies. I love what I am doing; that's the main thing.If 10 people see my movie and all ten really love it, then that means a lot to me, rather than ten million people go and see it and most of them hate it.I am not a perfectionist. Perfection doesn't exist in real life. It's a wrong title for me."
1,Aasif Mandvi,"If you don't acknowledge differences, it's as bad as stereotyping or reducing someone.The great joy of doing 'The Daily Show' for me is that I get to sit on the fence between cultures. I am commenting on the absurdity of both sides as an outsider and insider. Sometimes I'm playing the brown guy, and sometimes I'm not, but the best stuff I do always goes back to being a brown kid in a white world.In America, people think being South Asian is still kind of exotic. When you go outside New York and Chicago and L.A., there are people who have never tried Indian food... they've never even tasted it!In Britain, you never get away from the fact that you're a foreigner. In the U.S., the view is it doesn't matter where you come from.Traditional television as we have known it will make love to the Internet and have a child. That child will be the future. It's already happening, and it's hot!I never consciously got into comedy. It was sort of one of those things where I was a theater student, I was acting, I was doing comedy, I was doing dramatic stuff, so it's been something that I've always done and enjoyed doing and had an instinct to be relatively good at.The artist never really has any control over the impact of his work. If he starts thinking about the impact of his work, then he becomes a lesser artist.People lament that there's no roles being written for South Asian or Muslim characters. But their parents don't want their children to go into the entertainment field. You don't get it both ways.An artist's job is simply to take the mirror in front of your face and hold it there. It's not to give you any answers. It is simply to take that mirror and point it at you.I was born in India - but never really lived there."
2,Abhimanyu Singh,"Karthi is such a wonderful human being. He is always focused towards improvisations and keeps working on it.I think once you get noticed as an actor you get roles irrespective of the characters you portray.I have always tried to portray each role as differently as possible.I had zero connection to Bollywood or movies when I started out. I worked in theatre for eight years where luckily Makarand Deshpande mentored me, helped me to improve my body language and voice modulation.I have learnt the hard way that neither success nor failure last forever.It is a big deal to play the antagonist in a Rohit Shetty film.Gulaal' gave me a chance to channelise my restlessness into a character that had layers of complexity.I realised that if I wanted to act, I needed to join theatre where I could improve my acting skills first and also show my talent.I'm not the type who will go and ask people for roles.There was a lot of aggression in me. It comes from my Bihari roots, I guess."
3,Abhishek Bachchan,"You can work really hard on your physicality, on your craft, on the films you do. You can choose the best of directors, the best of productions, get the best technicians, you can put your entire body and soul into the making of a film, but at the end of the day, it all depends on the mood of that one audience member that goes into that theater.I've always basically done everything that's been offered to me. I'm one of the few actors who enjoy working a lot.I think it's important for an actor to see the work they've done because every time you revisit a work you come up with a new way of improving it. It's a good way to brush up your craft and your skills, so I think it's a good thing to do, keep seeing your films.In the Indian film industry, especially those of us who are in mainstream cinema, we invariably play a typical hero's role. More often than not, we cater to the public perception. However, there is a latent desire in most actors to do a role where you can go all out and experiment.In England or America, actors do not have to cater to an image. In India, it is almost demanded of us. Very seldom do you get a film where you can walk away from your image.There is one common thing in superstars - enthusiasm and humility towards their work. Off sets, they are big stars for others, and they carry themselves the way they want to. When they are working, they are not stars.The only fear I have is that I will wake up one day and nobody will allow me to do films. This is a fear every actor has.Indian weddings are elaborate. As a culture, we like to celebrate everything... Our weddings go on for sometimes a week, 10 days.Basketball is my favorite sport, and I'm also a very passionate football fan.I still feel that in India we look upon sports as a recreational activity - which it is - but people have to understand that there is a career in sports. It's not just necessary to be a doctor or a lawyer or an engineer, as most of us Indians appear to think that our children should grow up to be."
4,Aditya Roy Kapur,"I am not good with PR or in projecting a certain image of myself, and I don't give clarifications about rumours; that's it.I'm passionate about my work.When you are working with someone who is so aware of what they do, you become better, too.At the end of the day, it's a business; people want to make money. That's the intention with every film. It happens for some movies. For others, it doesn't.As actors, when we keep working every day, after a point of time, we just know all our emotional cards and how to play them.If I want to be a leading man in a film, box office numbers count because producers have invested money. I see no wrong in that process.In 'Kalank,' I am playing a character, which is quite strong, quiet a little complex yet interesting, that drew me towards the character when I heard the narration from director Abhishek Varman.When you are repeating your co-star, it's good to bring something new to the equation on screen.I think live-in relationship works for a few people, and it doesn't for others. I have never done it, so I can't speak about the pros and cons. I don't know if that will work for me or not, but I am definitely not close to the idea. For an arrangement like that to succeed, one needs to have the right feeling for the right person.Live-in relationships are common these days; that's why so many movies are being made on the subject."
5,Ajay Devgan,"Abroad, they have covered pretty much all subjects, explored every possibility, every twist. So similarities between ideas you have and those filmed abroad are quite possible.As far as I know, if you take your time, write a good script and make a good film, then give the audience time, they will accept it.By getting into distribution and production, I am actually widening my base.Earlier, I used to charge territories instead of my fees as an actor, but I realised it was better to keep the two apart. Now, I take my fees in cash, for acting, and keep the distribution thing separate.I don't see the risk, I enjoy performing stunts, and I don't get scared.I never talk about my personal life. After these rumours, I definitely do not want to comment on anything.I only want to do better work. That's the focus of my life.I'm going to keep making films I believe in. Whether I am successful or not is besides the point.If somebody had started on a remake of French Kiss before I announced my own film, I would have dropped my subject. If someone else starts after me, what am I to do?In the industry, you do need some ethics - if one film does well, then thousands get work and money comes back to the industry. I guess the bottomline is, if there are two versions, then the better one will click."
6,Ajay Mehta,"I've always had strong ties with Delhi, and I do stay in touch with my friends and periodically visit the capital. I started my schooling at St. Columbus High School before I went to Mayo College. Delhi, for me, is a historical city with all its beautiful monuments.Mayo College, where I got my grounding, is a private boarding school. It is a traditional school with brilliant teachers including some from overseas.I used to do a lot of plays in English, Hindi, and Urdu. I wanted to be an actor since I was three and a half.I feel respect is in your hands as an actor when portraying a character, particularly when it's from the Indian subcontinent. I do make a conscious effort to do so and often talk to the directors especially about the heavy accent when it's not needed.My father was a very special human being. He was brilliant in academics, sports and the arts. He wrote, performed and directed plays in English and Hindi/Urdu at his regiment.My father lived life to the fullest, even though it was cut short at a young age in 1962. He was known for his intelligence, wit, wisdom, a wonderful sense of humour, a great personality, and a genuine goodwill towards all.My mother enjoyed acting as well with my father, who used to direct her in plays at his regiment. My sister is an excellent singer. However, it was only me who decided to pursue acting as a career.Losing my father at a tender age was hard, and I felt it more so while growing up when I needed a father to talk to. Especially while pursuing an acting career where I would have loved his guidance and advice, since it was his passion as well."
7,Ajith Kumar,"If you look at it closely, 'Mankatha' is a politically incorrect film. It explores the darker side of the human mind, and I think, while watching it, people are, in a sense, redeeming themselves of their own guilt.As a child, I always wanted to be a race car pilot.I don't want the child in me to die. Fortunately, I'm lucky enough that my profession allows me to pursue my boyhood fantasies even as an adult.Filmmaking, I often like to say, is like Russian roulette. You never know what you'll get. The only thing you can do is find solace in the fact that, irrespective of the film's response, you work hard to make the money you do.Aren't we all dreamers? It's only because man dreamt of flying that we are travelling in planes. Behind all inventions, we see the dreams of people.I am glad that mankind on the whole are dreamers.I was the first person from my family to enter films. So, everything connected with films was new to me, including fans and fan clubs.I have a lot of respect for people, and I feel they are far more sensible and responsible than to ape or imitate somebody.I dropped out of school after my tenth standard. But both my elder brother and younger brother are highly educated.I would not say I was not interested in studies - it just wasn't there in me to pursue academics. I would open a page in the textbook and start thinking about everything under the sun except what was there in the book. I was more into extra-curricular activities and sports like NCC, rifle shooting, aero-modelling, bike racing, etc."
8,Akkineni Nagarjuna,"I exercise six days a week for one hour in the morning.Besides regular exercising, one should also take care of his or her daily habits such as adequate sleep and drinking lots of water.I don't believe in the concept of working out rigorously to pump muscles. It may be effective, but when you stop working out, it comes back to square one.I want to continue acting as long as I can because being on the sets is a big stress buster for me. I can't possibly think of stopping my visits to the sets because I'm old.When Raghavendra Rao garu approached me to do a film on Lord Venkateswara, my initial response was 'What more can we do than Annamayya?' But he asked me to go through the script, and I really liked it.My passion is films and making them.I'm a fan of a very few actors.Everybody deserves an opportunity to fulfill their dreams.I don't like anything about 2013. Too many things have happened, including 'Bhai.' I lost my way. Sometimes it happens, and I definitely feel bad about it.Everything about 'UY' is new and fresh, and we are extremely happy at the response from the audiences, as most people are walking out of cinema halls with a smile on their faces."
9,Akshay Kumar,"I have finally become a husband and I am genuinely enjoying every moment of it.It takes two hands to clap! I cannot be solely blamed for what happened in my relationships! If things soured, it happened because of both parties. Not just me!I'm glad that my films have been consistently faring well rather than one stray Friday!I'm glad that I'm being acclaimed as an actor. Today, when my hard work has paid off I can chill out about it.Playing a prisoner of war trapped in Pakistan for three years was a novelty for me. We made sure that we didn't talk about India versus Pakistan but about the emotions of people on both sides and how terrorism affects us all.I'd never do a film that would hurt anyone's sentiments, be it Indian or not.Controversies are a package deal in this industry. You just have to understand that and accept it.I'll do at least one action film every year because of my fans. This is my promise to them.It feels wonderful to be go back to the 1940s and recreate the whole era through my clothes, voice and body language. I am tired of playing the larger-than-life hero.I see the friends I made over the years who have become family today, people I became acquainted with who have achieved so much in their lives. They taught me something with each meeting."
10,Akshaye Khanna,"I do take my work very seriously, and I am first and foremost a very dedicated actor. I am also a very shy guy so you won't find me chatting or talking that much.Personal questions, or accusations about delivering flops or not doing good films end up being accusatory sessions where I have to defend myself. That's why I prefer not to do interviews.Gandhi: My Father' is a project very close to our hearts.The fact remains that I am a very artless and incompetent writer.I don't want to be known as an unprofessional actor. There was a time I was considered unprofessional, to a certain extent. I was very uncomfortable about that.I'm open to working with anybody and everybody as long as I have faith in them and they have faith in me.I am open to working with new directors as long as the script excites me.I have always wanted to do comedy.David Dhawan is the best as far as Indian comedy films are concerned.Everyone wants to do only those films which they find interesting. That is the way the industry works."
11,Ali,"Only humility can take you places.If a film works, you get more offers, appreciation and the latter is like oxygen. We survive on that.A comedian's career span is five or 10 years. I am lucky to have worked with so many distinguished actors and their grandsons.I am lucky I got roles where I worked for just seven days and made equal impact with the hero who worked for 70 days.I've been donating all the money I earn from the TV shows to a charitable trust.I want to serve the society in my own way.I have my own style and my own body language.When I am dubbing for my character, if I laugh at the figure on the screen, I know I have done well.My daughter Fathima is a bigger comedian than me. She makes me laugh all the time.Filmmakers often tell me to watch the original version. I never do."
12,Ali Fazal,"Cinema has evolved, and it is high time we stop policing it so rigorously.I have a great connect with the city, and I know the streets of Pune by heart. As a college student, I came down to visit friends. It is a great place to chill and hang out.We have to keep pace with changing times.In Bollywood, the film's stakes are as high as the actor. In Hollywood, they are way above, and the day we realise this in our industry, we will start appreciating actors.I see myself and my contemporaries being part of some good work in Bollywood.I love 'My Beautiful Laundrette' and 'Dangerous Liaisons.'The cast of 'Fukrey' will remain the same in the sequel. But the story is more of a fresh one.Theatre gives me a different high.Theatre is like an actor's nectar, like how cinema is a director's medium.I return to the stage time and again to see if I am worth anything."
13,Allu Arjun,"Much before I entered films, my dad walked into my room and saw me busy drawing something at 3 A.M. He stood there for some time and said, 'Whatever career choice you make, you are going to be successful.' I'll never forget those words. It gave me the confidence to be who I am today.I always consult my father before I take on a project. Not just me - even my brother goes to Dad and speaks to him of his business ideas. Dad has an amazing business acumen, and it would be foolish not to take his advice. Plus, he's our dad at the end of the day, and he would want to see us succeed. He always gives us the best advice.Dad never interferes in our personal matters. He is a very candid person and knows where to draw the line. He is always there for all of us in the family.After the release of my first film 'Gangothri,' my father was so happy that he surprised me by buying me a swanky high-end car.I don't believe in awards, and I think only film fare awards are faring.If a movie crosses budget and becomes a hit, no one cares. They care only when it doesn't do well.Everything changes with time. I am not so experienced enough to analyze what the people love in me.If we give something positive to others, it will return to us. If we give negative, that negativity will be returned.There are two types of directors: the directors who take and directors who give.I keep myself away from people who talk badly about others."
14,Amitabh Bachchan,"Basically I am just another actor who loves his work and this thing about age only exists in the media.Frankly I've never really subscribed to these adjectives tagging me as an 'icon', 'superstar', etc. I've always thought of myself as an actor doing his job to the best of his ability.I just lead my life as naturally, as normally as I possibly can. But I can't help it if controversy is hounding me day in and day out. I'm quite amazed sometimes by the way they go about it. I grow a beard and it lands up in the editorial in The Times of India.I am looking forward to going to Dubai because it gives us an opportunity to interact with each other. We can sit and enjoy each other's company. We can go out for a walk without worrying about shooting schedules.No new projects at the moment. There are restrictions to how much I can take on. And I need to finish those that I am committed to do before thinking ahead. But I'd rather they take final shape before we talk of them.The amount of things I have been through and the remarkable ways in which the body has reacted is just phenomenal. No wonder I became religious, because you don't know why something's happening to you and you don't know how you bounced back.Dearest TV media and vans outside my home, please do not stress and work so hard.It's a war zone, my body, and one which has been through a great deal.I sometimes lament the fact that I do not have the benefit of a complete and ailment free body structure.I did not resign from politics because of Bofors. I resigned because I do not know how to play petty politics. I did not know back then and I don't know now either."
15,Amrish Puri,I am happy to play the bad man.I am like a brick.
16,Anil Kapoor,"Not exactly but I get inspiration from stories which are unconventional.I have lot of respect of filmmakers who work in Telugu and Tamil.Everyone starts a film thinking that it would be a big hit. But sometimes it goes haywire.But it is not conscious strategy to go for unconventional roles.If you make a feelgood film which is complete candyfloss, where everybody is good and everything is beautiful and hunky dory, it won't appeal to the audience.I ran away from my house when I was about 12 years old to audition for a film.India has the purity, the innocence. India knows what it wants. There is a direction. It has so much to offer.Instead of focusing on my looks I focus on the character that I am playing.In India I've been to all the award functions, but that was in Hindi; now it's in English so it's a much bigger scale.There are hurdles, there are handicaps, hardships you have to face in life, but you hope for a great future."
17,Anupam Kher,"I was born in a poor family, a lower middle class family. My father was a clerk in the forest department. I was very bad at studies. I was not very good at sports, also.I was 28 when I played the role of a 65 year old man in my first film.I enjoy being recognized. I'll be very sad if people stop recognizing me. I'll be very sad if I'm not interviewed, because that's a very amazing process.I wrote a book on life coaching, because my life became my own reference point how to live.Every individual suffers from the fear of failure, but you can change your destiny only when you overcome it.When I staged the play and narrated my story to the audience, people found it amazing that after facing so many hardships, I have gone on to do 482 films.Being a popular director or actor's son can be frightening in this industry. What if you are not able to make it?It is important to be financially savvy when you turn producer. As a director, you just need to have a good script in hand.I had spent many days hungry; had slept on railway stations at times because I did not have money to pay for a hotel room... there were moments when I felt I had compromised my dignity as a human being and as an actor.One time I nearly experienced failure was when I was acting in 'Hum Aapke Hain Kaun' in 1994. One day, I woke up and found that part of my face was paralysed."
18,Aparshakti Khurana,"I come from a theatre group called Drama Tech in Delhi. When its founder Mr. Chopra called me and appreciated my work, that was also satisfying because he gave me my first play.I speak Hindi with a Punjabi accent, not a Haryanvi accent.I don't want to play the lead and look like a hero. I am open to do character roles; what is the harm in it?My brother was a radio jockey while I was studying law. I have assisted a lawyer at the High Court. But I decided to give it up. I cleared auditions for radio jockey in the first go, and within a week, I was on air.Once I failed in cricket, I joined a law course, but when it also did not work out, it was another setback. When you get back-to-back failures, you automatically start to work harder in life.In 2009, it was the right time to start working in the radio industry.When you start your creative journey after failures, I think you already work to perform and want to give your best. I was blessed to have the right kind of people around me.I would call myself a radio performer who has just jumped in front of the camera and is very happy.The best thing about working with Tahira bhabhi is her positivity and clarity about what she wants from you as an artist, an actor, and even as a brother-in-law. I think she is very clear about life, and that's what I love about her.Whenever I meet people, they call me Bittu of Stree or Omkar of Dangal. And I believe not many people know that I'm the brother of Ayushmann."
19,Arbaaz Khan,"There will always be a sense of things you want to achieve, where you want to be, a sense of disappointment, a few regrets here and there. Those are always going to linger. How you cope with them and how you move on is what your life is about.I am as sensitive as my brothers and other members of my family.Being sensitive means caring for your own feelings as well as those of others.Doing funny roles is something I enjoy as I am like that in my personal life.When you are living alone then you tend to take life casually.Fatherhood has gone and done much more than marriage. It has made me a far more responsible person.I like to read. I like to spend time on the Net. I like to watch movies.I don't see myself turning into a romantic hero. I may not be comfortable doing that. I may not be cut out to do that. It may not even suit my image.I have a dormant director in me. I do think about subjects and films I want to make. I get pretty excited about them.My family, we siblings are there for each other."
20,Arfi Lamba,"It is all about playing a challenging role, and whether a film is a commercial one or not does not really matter.In 'Fugly,' I play a very middle-class guy with whom anyone can relate. At the same time, playing such characters is not as easy as it sounds.I arrived thinking I had these amazing looks and body and that I would straight away land the lead in a Yash Chopra film. Those fancy ideas got quashed soon enough.After joining theatre, I started thinking that acting in films was not half as challenging as theatre.When I didn't become the quintessential Yash Chopra hero, I got into the 'struggle' period and became negative.As a true-blue Punjabi, I have learnt to tackle disappointments, especially since I have no godfather in the industry.Success is just around the corner, but I don't want to rush into anything.I think I was born to be an actor.My role in 'Slumdog Millionaire' was a cameo, but it did expose me to cinema and took me to Cannes. I then did 'Prague,' which was a very niche film.I've been a protected child, but I moved out for further studies when I was 16, and I have travelled quite a bit by myself."
21,Arjun Kapoor,"I have made my mistakes my strengths instead of looking at whose fault it is.If I feel insecure, then I am in the wrong profession. I have to trust my director and the material he has given me.I signed 'Aurangzeb' because I loved the story. I thought it was an untold tale. For whatever reason, the audience did not like the film. Fair enough, but I still enjoyed the process.Who would say no to a film like 'Gunday?'I want all my films to do well.Success demands sacrifices. I believe it's a small price to pay for the adulation and love one receives.It's silly to have a prototype, because one inevitably falls for someone unexpected. My only criterion is she shouldn't just look nice; she must have a personality, too.A relationship will be futile if it's based just on physicality. Intellectual stimulation is a must for me.I have learnt that women are superior beings. They have a higher threshold of pain and are more understanding and accepting than men. Also, if you listen to them, you'll understand them better.An actor should never be influenced by the surroundings, because you have to submit completely, and trust me, it's not a good feeling when you know that your father is going to come and watch you work every day!"
22,Arjun Rampal,"What challenges me is this - I want to walk out of a film with the experience of having done a film, not with a feeling that I have sleepwalked through it.For me, what is most important is the element of surprise. If I can surprise you with every film of mine, that is exactly what I am trying to do.India needs a change - it cannot be ruled by 80-year-olds and by people who have done nothing for it.I would be lying if I said I'm not flattered being voted as the 'Time's' Most Desirable Man of 2012. Frankly, I have no idea how the desirability quotient is arrived at. If it is just drop dead good looks, then I have to thank God and my parents for it.I think it is a combination of looks, aura, success, the energies that one gives out, the person you are and the person you feel like that makes you 'desirable.' When the outside world sees you as a man who is responsible for himself and his family, as a man who is fit and sensitive, it kind of ups your desirability.I have not taken my good looks seriously from the beginning. When I would be teased by my friends about my looks, I would just make a self-deprecating remark and let it pass.Physical attributes can make you appealing, but to keep the appeal going, one has to draw from within. You have to be a real person. Your fans and the people you associate with have to be able to see beyond your looks. You have to be a good friend, dutiful son and a good family man.I've been lucky to get some path-breaking films, which proved to be the turning point in my career. Be it 'Rock on!' 'The Last Lear' or 'Raajneeti,' directors started working in a different way.I like my films to have a certain amount of realism - something that's thought provoking and intelligently written. More than the amount on the pay cheque, I look for a level of respectability as an actor.Born in Jabalpur, I was brought up in Deolali, where my father ran a small business of making fire extinguishers."
23,Ashish Sharma,"I respect women but do not necessarily believe that women need to compete with men.You can ask my wife - there has always been mutual respect between us, and I believe women should be respected for what they are; at no point should they feel the need to be like men.There are too many positive and goody male characters on TV, and they work, so its good for them. I feel each to their own. If it works for them, it's fine. I don't connect to such characters, so I won't do them.I'd rather sit at home than be a part of a popular show and be a piece of furniture.If you see the roles that I've done so far, whether it was Gunahaon ka Devtaa, Chandragupta Maurya, or Rab Se, everything has been starkly different from each other.I choose grey characters, as I enjoy playing a human character. I don't shy away from showing the shortcomings of my characters.We always see a trend on TV, and others follow suit. I think 'Rangrasiya' will be a trend setter, too.Whenever you give a shot, the nervous energy in your stomach is the key to that emotional breakdown, that kick that is needed to perform.I have been doing action roles for a while and really wanted to explore the other side of my personality on screen.I haven't had any formal training, but I guess dance comes naturally to us - people from the north. See how much we dance at weddings."
24,Ashish Vidyarthi,"My father is a Malayalee, my mother is a Bengali.As an actor, I have travelled, met people and discovered that the only thing that matters is how we treat life, not complaining nor wanting better things.I was in a school called Shiv Niketan, run by Elizabeth Gauba, where she gave a lot of importance to people expressing themselves in whatever way they wanted - some could draw and answer, some could dance and answer, while some could act.No actor is totally happy with the roles they get.All of us play different roles in our chosen career. I play the role of an actor. But I realised I am also an actor apart from various roles I play in my personal life.Sometimes we think roles define us. One can emerge beyond the confines of their roles to make an impact on society.Doing anything with dedication impacts life positively.I like to be a creative variable rather than sticking to a dogma.I would be lying if I say I don't find it scary each time I come on stage.I'm essentially a traveller. I love to do many things."
25,Asrani,"When I was in film institute, stage plays were compulsory part of our training.The stage is one place where you come face to face with your audience, unlike cinemas where you cannot see the applause or the booing by the audience.Theatre gives you an altogether different kind of thrill which every actor who wants to grow must try.Every actor tries to come to Broadway be it Richard Burton, Marlon Brando or Liz Taylor or Shirley McClain.I had to work in 'Mastizaade,' I felt embarrassed.Bimal Roy never kept comedy out of the story line.One doesn't have to resort to cheap imitations of characters or people around you to make others laugh. At least, that is what I've always believed in.On a serious note, comedy should be something that you can enjoy with your family and not snigger when alone or with friends.Indoreans are not only welcoming, but very homely.Comedy is very effortless."
26,Ayushmann Khurrana,"Being a young parent, you can play cricket, football, and I can play chess with my son. In fact, he plays the piano better than I do.It is good to be a young father, a young parent. You have that energy, and you are growing up with them.I am the public, a boy from Chandigarh who's bought tickets in black and revered films since childhood, and when I choose scripts, I take out the garb of an actor-slash-star, and I consume the script as a layman.I couldn't be a conventional commercial actor without being a star-kid. That kind of a big film needs a certain mounting, a little paraphernalia around you. And nobody would give me that.I was very nervous as a child and had stage fright.In theatre, you learn the story is more important than the actor.I was very immature when I married.I always thought millennials are going westward, and they probably won't understand vernacular poetry.I have certain viewpoints that come out in certain shayaris.I approach every film as my first film."
27,Barun Sobti,"I have passed on on a lot of roles. I purely and simply do what I like.For me, as an actor, the challenge is mostly before the film starts when you have to get into the psychology of the character.Birthdays, for me, are not really important. It is just like any other day.My wife and I love to travel, so if we don't have work on either her or my birthday, we definitely travel.I am definitely a beach person. In fact, I am so much a beach person that my wife is allergic to beaches now.I like to have my share of parties, but I am not the late night person. Not that we don't do parties at all, but that does not happen very frequently.I personally think that people should spend more time and money on their marriages instead of weddings.You can't change what time has in store for you, as the only constant that I've known is change.The content has to be good; medium doesn't matter to me.No one actually knows how popular you are or how people think of you until and unless a few of the people who like your work walk up to you and let you know that you are really good. You can see the honesty in their eyes."
28,Bobby Deol,"I have done all kinds of roles - comedy, action, romance, and thrillers. Just name the genre, and I've done it.I always wanted to be an actor. My father inspired me since I was three years old.Good films will run, and people will watch it irrespective of whether it is suspense or a comedy.Every actor gets an image without wanting one. A lot of romantic heroes want an action hero tag, but they are unable to succeed even though their films are good.There is a sense of comfort working with Abbas-Mustan.I have seen both versions of 'The Italian Job' and loved both of them.Remakes are happening for a long time, and it is happening in the West, too. I don't believe anything is wrong in that.I can't think of any actor who doesn't have a flop in his career.Life is really good for me.My father and brother always forced me to work out, and I never liked doing it."
29,Boman Irani,"I get scared when I think I'm going to miss my flight. I get obsessed when I actually miss a flight.Chilli ice cream doesn't taste bad. But I wouldn't eat it again.It used to bug me that I couldn't even afford to take my family for a proper holiday. I didn't have any professional knowledge, and getting a photographer's job in a magazine was out of the question. So, armed with a Pentax K1000, I started going to various maidans of Mumbai, looking for subjects.To find one's calling is perhaps not the easiest thing in the world, but probably the most important.I like the cold; I don't have problem with cold, and I don't have problem with rain either, as long as people are smiling. You know, early in my career, I used to wonder about this fan frenzy, but now I realize that there is genuine love, respect and affection, which makes me very proud to be an actor.Sometime you go out and you wonder why these people are standing in the rain, and then you realize that years ago you were a fan, too. I, too, was chased by cops for watching my favourite celebrities.I used to follow celebrities, and I remember I watched Sanjay Dutt and Pooja Bhatt shooting for 'Sadak'. I was standing on the road at three in the night, but little did I know that I would be making a film with Sanjay at some point in my career.Once, Naseeruddin Shah told me that the wafer shop was the best acting school that I could have attended. And I completely agree. I observed every customer very minutely and picked up some quirk or the other. Later, I used those experiences while playing different characters.Our film industry as well as the audiences are now open to unconventional pairings and subjects, which has aided my journey greatly.Very few movies remain in public memory as landmark films, and I want to see whether '3 Idiots' will be up there with some of the wonderful films that have come out of this country... Hopefully, we'll come to know in a few years whether it can become one of the great films."
30,Brahmanandam,"I am a Venkateswara Swami devotee.I went to Mumbai thinking I will be away from media and fans, but right from the Governor of Maharashtra to aam janata, at least 60 people would come to visit me every day. There were calls, messages and I was so touched. I didn't know that people loved me so much and they want to see me back in action.I want to be visible to my fans.It's a great gift to be able to make people laugh.I'm the seventh child among eight siblings and have always had a gift for art.I'm sure every actor works as hard as me, if not more.Talent is a combination of perfect comic timing, diction, modulation, great script writing and most importantly, an invincible will, if you may call it so.Disney movies are a great outing for the entire family, and my children are huge fans of their classics, especially 'The Lion King.'Writer Kona Venkat is very good friend of mine.I do whatever the directors and writers ask me to do."
31,Dalip Tahil,"Destiny has put me in the profession that has kept me happy, and where I was supposed to be.People are always put in a box or slot.In the early days, some producers and directors saw me in the musical 'Evita' and cast me in their movies. They heard me singing on stage also, but they couldn't translate that into a Hindi movie song.I remember when I got into movies, the only way singers could be heard was to through playback singing in movies. Then gradually came the music companies promoting independent pop singers.Anyone can pick up an instrument if they want to express themselves or write a song and put it on YouTube. It's always technology that comes and turns around how we think creatively and what we do creatively.The everyday issues that we witness against women in the present day will throw light on the respect women enjoyed at the time of Ramayan.I worked for some of the major productions and did many jingles and voiceovers.Finally after 19 years of stage work Shyam Benegal noticed me and I got my first break as an actor in 'Ankur' after that I have been seen on and off on screen as a bad guy, as a father or as an uncle.Sindhis have a rich heritage, but they suffered massively during the Partition.My father was an Air Force officer at the time of partition."
32,Deep Roy,"I was a big fan of 'Star Trek.' But then again, you know, 'Star Trek', 'Star Wars', 'Doctor Who', I wasn't a big fan, but you know, when they ask you and they cast you and it drops in your lap, how can you say no to these franchises.Life is what you make of it. You can make it easy on yourself or you can make it hard.I don't play any instruments, but I do read a lot.I enjoy wine collecting and great food.Inspiration comes from within yourself. One has to be positive. When you're positive, good things happen.I am proportional, and I'm very lucky for that.Whether you're a dwarf, whether you're a midget, it's all branding.I see them turn around to get a second look. You hear a lot of people laugh at you. So what? I used to get upset about it, but not anymore. You know, laugh all you can.When Tim and I first discussed the part in 2003, he told me, 'I'd love for you to play five Oompas.' But five Oompas quickly turned into 165 - and they're not computerized; I did each one individually myself.I'm not a professional dancer, but I can move!"
33,Dev Anand,"Life is too short. I don't have time to speak slowly.You create a work of art. You do not know whether it will get public sanction. Sometimes outstanding films do no business, and sometimes films which are not so good work.I was the leading star in 1945. I slowed down my pace of acting assignments after I came into direction.I keep drawing inspiration from people every day. All of a sudden, something strikes me so hard and dramatically, and then a dream comes - I sit down, cut it off and make a script out of it.Motion picture making is a very, very involved affair. It is completely my baby. I'm a thorough professional. I plan films right from the conception of an idea to its final execution.If I wanted, I could have ruled half of Bombay.It's an institution that was born with my brother Chetan and me. I did it for him. I was becoming a big star in the late 1940s, and he needed a company to make films. So when he left Navketan, I brought in Goldie, and when Goldie left, I carried on alone. No book on Indian cinema is complete without mention of Navketan.Somebody came up with the idea of a double role, and I think 'Hum Dono' gave me a great double role - I played Captain Anand and Major Verma, the 'haw-haw' type of major.'Hum Dono' was accepted in a very big way. It was the official entry at the 1962 Berlin Film Festival.No film should be meaningless."
34,Dhanush,"Every man plays many roles. So far, I have played father the best.You can't always expect to work with a director who guarantees success.There is no such thing as a Bollywood hero or Hollywood hero. All you see on the screen is the lead actor's interpretation of the role that has been conceived by the writer.If I was not an actor, I would have been working in a five star hotel as a chef.Definition of love differs for different humans. If I will talk about me then its something that makes you forget about everything else.Unfortunately, I can only act; I do not have the looks, but I am very happy with what God has given me.Music is my breath, blood and food - without music I would perish; the actor in me would die.I have no clue as to where my interest and love for music came from. In fact, I have never learnt any music either, though I wish that I could just close my eyes and play the piano - that is my most cherished desire.I have played so many romantic roles that I don't know if I am really a romantic in real life. I get confused about the real me.I get emotionally attached with every film I do, and that stops me from being critical. I can't fight my emotions."
35,Dilip Kumar,"During my film career, I have received love and affection from Indian cinegoers. I have received unconditional love from them.I know and live with the real Dilip Kumar. He is a simple man, hard working, who has survived time.India means everything to me. It is my homeland. India is my country. It is here that I have gotten love and affection as a film star from millions and millions of my fans over the last five decades.I have a piece of land in Delhi, but I have never had enough money to support dual establishments. I always thought of owning a house in Delhi as well. When you go to London or Switzerland, you dream of having a house even there. But you cannot have everything. I have a plot in Delhi, so I think I should have a house here as well.There is no disillusionment about India as far as I am concerned. There could never come a time when I would get disillusioned with my own country.Even if there was an opportunity to school yourself in different characters - characters that have distinct personalities which may be totally different from yours, you have got to completely divorce your own personality to be able to go over to the other personality.I think personality correction is necessary for successful men, like prime ministers, businessmen, politicians... it's essential that one should keep an eye on one's own personality. You must have seen people in politics who become chief ministers and then pass into oblivion - how egotistical they became and how pathetic they look.If you allow fame to get the better of you, you become nuisance, a public nuisance, a nuisance as a friend, as a member of the family, a nuisance to yourself.My becoming a film actor was more a twist of tale than a chosen course because I dared not to think I could ever become an actor. I couldn't even walk up on a stage and say 'Thank you' when we were to receive trophies at our sports meets at college."
36,Dulquer Salmaan,"For any actor, being part of a Mani Ratnam film is a great experience. I grew up watching his films.People working in films are somewhat like gypsies: we move from set to set and spent weeks, sometimes even longer working while shooting a film. Right from the spot boys to the make-up guys and cast and crew, we become a kind of family.I can make chicken curry, rice, kheema... I am a foodie and enjoy varied cuisines. My favourites are Korean and Japanese.I enjoy working in movies that appeal to and will be seen by many people.For me, style is all about confidence. What you wear, both in terms of clothing and jewellery, should add to your confidence.I might play characters that are loud in the movies, but in real life, I'm not loud in terms of personality.I feel lucky that I always have a number of films to choose from. I would like to come out of my comfort zone while doing various roles, and I don't want to keep repeating my characters.It is when I am convinced about my character that I can do justice to that role.I enjoy clothes. My mother tells me how, even as a kid, I used to choose my own clothes. I have a feel for it, and I do the costume coordination for my photo shoots as well. Many a time, even my characters wear the clothes I choose.I don't want to get into a comfort zone. I am getting characters of varying shades, which I believe will help me grow as an actor."
37,Duniya Vijay,"My biggest grouse since the time I filed for divorce has been that when all the drama unfolded, the children were made pawns. That should never be the case. You never know how it affects them.What is wrong in getting divorced? If a couple is incompatible and just cannot stay married anymore, should they put on a show of togetherness just for the sake of society, or, for that matter, any extended family?I am an actor who turned hero at age 32, after many years of struggle. I wanted to break the stereotype that only good-looking men with a good complexion, height and physique can be heroes, which I have managed to do.The aim is to move from doing just action dramas to establishing myself as someone who can do family dramas as well."
38,Emraan Hashmi,"My films have a bold interpretation. They are unapologetic about showing intimacy. Going by the number of people who come to watch my films, this is what our target audience yearns for.As an actor, I was not accepted for the longest time. But it did not deter me, as the audience had accepted me. I never compared myself with any other actors. I never had any game plan and took whatever came my way.The effort always remains that my new film outdoes my last in terms of performance and gets better box office success. Box office is the sole reason why I do films.Sometimes I know a film might not pull the audience to the theatres and have a great collection at the box office. But I need to do these films for creative satisfaction and give something different to the audience.I am tired of kissing on screen. I have to do it because it is synonymous with me. Also, the producers and directors want to add that element. I don't give it too much importance.Somewhere after you have few successful films, there is a fear of losing what you have got. It is very easy in the beginning, as you are a risk taker, have nothing to lose, and there is no perception about you.I am not doing comedy because the genre is successful. If that was the case, I would have done a run-of-the-mill comedy film. I set my own trends. I like to give something new and different to my audiences. I want to do the kind of comedy that has been missing till now.I have kissed in almost all the films except in 'Once Upon A Time In Mumbaai.' I'm not sure if my kissing on screen has anything to do with the success of a film, but producers make sure to put a kissing scene or two. They feel my kissing scenes are my lucky streak.I don't know the definition of a star; I am just an actor. I prefer doing hard work, as I feel luck can't do much in absence of hard work. I am a lazy person - when I entered into this industry, I thought it was a cakewalk, but I have realised it needs a lot of patience and hard work.It is fun to see girls going mad about me or dancing around to get one glimpse of me. These are major perks of being an actor. But you need to be cautious and respectful."
39,Fahadh Faasil,"Whenever I have really enjoyed being part of a film, it has worked well for me.I enjoyed working on 'Maheshinte Prathikaram.'I think everything is temporary.I want to entertain viewers as much as possible.I would like to do movies of all genres.I would like to look funny on screen, doing comedy.When I choose the scripts, all I look forward to is an impressive narration.The five directors in '5 Sundarikal' experimented, and it was a very personal exercise. Amal, Anwar, Aashiq, and Sameer have done things that they have never done before. Debutant Shyju has also made a beautiful film.I am a bad boy. I don't come across clearly to a lot of people, so I am bad for them.When I began acting, my biggest fear was whether the audience will appreciate the kind of films I do."
40,Gautam Rode,"I choose roles according to my sensibilities.I have to evolve as an actor.I can't do only goody-goody roles. I can't be complacent, I have to play characters in different genres.Never say never, but I won't kiss just for the heck of it.My breakfast consists of skimmed milk, a scoop of whey protein, and granola with dry fruits and oats.My cheat food is mainly all the sweet stuff I love to eat - pastries, chocolates, cakes and besan ka ladoo.When I am travelling or shooting outdoors, and if there is no gym around, I do pull-ups. If there is a bar somewhere, I manage push-ups, squats, and generally I just sweat it out in the room or my vanity van. But I make sure my workout regime is never hampered at any cost!I have been a vegetarian for a few years now, and I am honestly managing it quite well in sync with my workouts and maintaining my physique as well. From whey protein to cottage cheese to tofu, all my proteins, carbs and far content are well in place and balanced.U.P. is always in news because of its politics.About Lucknow, I have become a frequent visitor here now and have started knowing the city quite well. In fact, I was also planning to set up a cafe here as I loved the city so much. There is so much scope for business here."
41,Govinda,"I chose the Congress for its thoughts, its acceptance of people of all opinions, and its wide perspective. Another reason for joining the party was my family, which is attached to the Congress for a long period of time.My mother once used to be a Congress leader.When you join a political party, you are attaching yourself with an organisation of skilled people. And when you work with an organisation, your working capacity becomes double. One can perform better with the help of an organisation to implement their thoughts.When your work speaks, you don't need to speak at all.I don't think a film has ever worked at the box office because of a star.If the film is good, it will work whether it has a star or no star.I am not worried about failure. I have made my career in this industry, so it does not scare me.I don't think the failure of one film means the end of your career.I want to get away from my comic image. Not that I won't do any more comic roles, but I won't opt for the usual 'Govinda' type of comedies.I feel like covering my children's eyes when they watch television. It's better that they spend their time doing something constructive."
42,Harshvardhan Rane,"When people who are close to me say that they see positive changes in me as I grow, it makes me work harder on myself. Life always surprises us with something new, and I want to be capable enough to handle it.In the time of social media, I get lots of wishes. It's overwhelming! What makes the day most special is the love I get from my fans, who try to make the occasion extra special. Almost 50 days before my birthday, they have started making plans. In fact, I have been receiving letters, too.The fact that Sanjay Leela Bhansali wanted me to be part of his film was a high point in my life.I wanted to do something new and different. People expected me to do negative roles. I wanted to break the norm, and because of that, I lost on some great work as well.At the age of 16, I ran from my house, did odd jobs till l landed work on television and then in film industry. My first job was at an STD booth in Delhi. Then I came to Mumbai, where I distributed DVDs, and that is when I got my first TV show offer, 'Left Right Left.' I have never planned things in my career.Shah Rukh Khan is a self-made man, and he does inspire with what he does. It is foolish to think that one can try and imitate or modify what he does. I have been original in my performances so far.I am a big-structured guy, and so I always felt my weight was justified until I chanced upon Cavemen's diet.Simply put, Cavemen's diet is a diet plan which suggest food eaten by the cavemen. Cavemen ate what was available - like meat, vegetables and a few nuts. What we grow for food is carbohydrates, and that leads to weight gain. I started this diet a few years ago, and ever since, I haven't had carbs at all.I load on proteins, veggies, fruits and nuts and never took support of supplements.I have lost close to 20 kilos, and it has kind of helped prepare my character for 'Sanam Teri Kasam.'"
43,Himesh Reshammiya,"Many people do not know how hard I work. There are many days I work more than 18 hours.I am happy to be a composer.I love to simplify the ragas and use them in my music as much as possible.See, talent is important, and so is hard work. But if you don't have destiny and good karma on your side, talent cannot do the magic by itself.I make singers sing every note fully and wait till they hit the right note.Big producers trust the music directors. Small directors are insecure but like to experiment.I always believe that it is destiny and divine intervention that are with me.I do everything from my heart.Critics said I am nasal, but my fans made me hit. So I will not stop singing if critics don't like me.I am a huge fan of Yash Chopra, Karan Johar, Farah Khan, Sooraj Barjatiya or Sanjay Leela Bhansali or Aditya Chopra. They are great legends."
44,Hiten Tejwani,"Yes, I was married once, before Gauri entered my life.Divorce isn't the best thing that can happen to anyone.My marriage with Gauri is the best thing that could ever happen to me.I think everyone should be a parent at some point in life.I remember as a kid, my two brothers and I had to share gifts. We couldn't afford to have one for each of us. Today, when I buy a gift I have to buy for both my kids as I can't give something to only one of them.Nothing can match the feeling you get when you finally get something after waiting for it for a long time.The values my parents taught me were the best gift I ever got.There are many kids who are greedy or don't appreciate things or take things for granted but it's not their fault. It's the parents who have to show and teach them the difference between right and wrong.I love talking, even to strangers.The normal perception is that you expect your partner to change for you. But you have to remember that you have married the other person because of the way he or she is."
45,Hrithik Roshan,"I have been elevated to such a high status that the fall will be very steep.I make the best Spanish omelettes in the world, but I won't tell you the recipe!I can be the best James Bond there is.It's not a prerequisite for an actor to be obsessed about his looks. I know there are people who don't look in the mirror at all, and I'm getting there.Life hits you hard. But it takes you three seconds to decide if you are a superhero or not. I am.I can't act, and so I have to live that particular character in my real life and then exhibit it on screen.I don't consider myself a good actor.If a film is good, it will work no matter what.The world helps you to keep evolving and hope it's for better. You have to rise above all the tragedies in life. You have to grow, and if you stop growing, you are old.I take my time to get into the mindset of the character and say my lines. I really have to be the person that I am playing."
46,Indrans,"At first, like every other actor, I wanted to do characters with deep traits - what we call 'serious characters.'At times, I have had the opportunity to play character roles in movies like 'Kathavasheshan.' Still, I act in all the roles I am offered if it has something special.I love young directors who experiment with subjects. But I am definitely not choosy. I don't get that many offers to be selective.Big or small, I perform all my duties with utmost sincerity; that's the only way I can pay back to the filmmakers who trust me.I was already in the industry as a costume designer and opportunities to act in films came naturally. I must have designed costumes for over 100 films."
47,Irrfan Khan,"We don't have a culture of realistic acting in India.Parsi theater was known for melodrama.Sometimes when you're playing a very intense character, a disturbed character, you find other layers. That's much more interesting to me, rather than just playing 'intense.' I find it too boring.I can't think of a more pathetic situation for an actor than to do a film and not connect to it. And I pray to God that I never face that situation.I've realized that my... let me call it 'destiny' or some force that has pushed me to identify looking for your comfort zone as a kind of limitation. And everybody has a tendency to fall into the comfort zone. I did that in the early stage of my career.A film engages you emotionally and intellectually.I'm trying to strike a balance between Bollywood and Hollywood.I will only do a Hollywood film when there is something special offered to me.You cannot reduce the power of story with the tag of money because it's not a share market. So you must know the seriousness of the power of storytelling.When you come out of the theatre and you don't even talk about that film or remember it, then it disappoints me."
48,Ishaan Khatter,"The first time I met Janhvi on the sets, I took her to watch 'La La Land,' because she hadn't seen it. Soon, we started bonding over cinema - both of us are film buffs - and we realised we share a natural equation.I have no intention to make a name for myself and to separate my identity from my brother's name. I am proud to be identified as Shahid's brother. There is no shame in it.I believe if you are sincere with your work and you are good at it, then your identity will be created by default.When there is hate or negative comment, I try to ignore it and try to not bother myself with such stuff.I managed to make my debut with my favourite, Majid Majidi, whereas 'Dhadak' is giving me a huge mass exposure.My acting style changes according to the way a character is imagined.'Pressure' is not a word that I associate with very much; it is a matter of perspective. It depends on your disposition as a person. It can either be that you are pressurised by something, or you can be motivated and encouraged by it.I am extremely eclectic in choosing my films as an audience, and as a direct result of that, I love exploring, I love cinema, and I love learning from different experiences.I love to play varied roles. That's the most exciting thing for me.'Sairat' is such a consuming movie, so I was stuck into its story. It has such a poignant end that I was quite moved by it."
49,Jackie Shroff,"If someone out there gets his 15 minutes of glory by using my name, so be it.Indian cinema has completed 100 years. How many new stories can you bring every time? It's not possible.Salman Khan is doing really well in his career. I know him since the time he was growing up.I never thought I would become an actor. When I started out, I never thought I would come so far. Acting was not my passion. When I experienced the highs of being an actor, I started liking it, and it gradually became my passion.Just because you have given five successful films doesn't make you God.Working with Subhash Ghai is always a different experience. Subhashji is my mentor. I'm always glad to work with him.I keep surprising myself with films like 'Mission Kashmir,' 'Albela,' 'Farz,' and 'Bas Itna Sa Khwaab Hai.' All the roles are very different.I always believe whatever is written in your fate will happen.I wanted to be a chef; I became a hero.What I treasure the most is people coming up to me in the elevator and saying, 'You really did a great job': neighbours who congratulate for a job well done or little fans who hug me and say they want to be like me."
50,Javed Jaffrey,"Nothing works like success.I have been successful in comic roles and people think that is all that I can do.It is very important for me to do different things so that people see that my range is more than just comedy.I would say I was lucky that I got different kinds of roles.I don't know how one can differentiate between comedies. A burger is a burger and though it may taste differently in different food joints, the fact remains that it is still a burger. It's the same with comedies.In 'Mr Shrimati,' I had a long role as a woman. A cabaret number was also picturised on me. I really worked hard in that film and feel that to date, no man has matched my level when playing a woman.There is a very thin line when a man plays woman. If you're not careful, you may end up looking like a eunuch. If you don't enact your role properly, you can look very bad.I essay a negative or a positive character depending on whether it's a principle role and how much it drives the movie.I so hate the term Bollywood. I know it's become synonymous with the industry but really we are 'Indian cinema.'In India, there's so much strife, pain and trouble that song, dance and going to the movies is respite."
51,Jeetendra,"I know these are my mandatory overs, but I would like to do films for as long as I breathe.Amitabh is No. 1 to No. 10.I enjoyed harassing tram conductors.When I was working actively, I used to be in the studios for 12 hours. I didn't have any time for my family.There are lots of things that keep me busy.Films of stars as well non stars are working at the box office. People look out for content driven films.According to fathers, their kids are always good.Life may have plans that will completely overthrow your pettiness.I can never forget Sridevi's determination to make it big in Bollywood.Were Sridevi and Jaya Prada rivals? Look, I worked with both extensively. I even did films in which both were my co-stars. I never saw then being anything but thoroughly professional with one another."
52,Jim Sarbh,"I think that's the magic of any part - unravelling the mystery of what kind of person your guy is based on the words he says and the actions that he does.I started to view theatre like a spiritual experience. You're on stage saying somebody else's lines, but you're saying them with full commitment of being that person.If I was lying on the side of the mountain, dying, would I have any regrets? Yeah. I would regret not making films.When a film does well, everyone is usually happy and grateful, but for me, the impression the film leaves upon my mind is created during the process of filming; my memories are not a reflection of critics' reviews and box office figures.It feels good to be able to work with a director and actors I've admired.Acting is acting, regardless of the medium.Ideally, for me, the power of appreciation lies in getting better roles and being given more responsibility as an actor.I did plays because I liked plays. I studied psychology because I was fascinated by the subject, and I hope to keep doing films because I love the medium.I would love to work with anybody who has a good story to tell - Patrick Graham, Vikramaditya Motwane, Anurag Kashyap, Neeraj Ghaywan, Coen Brothers, Wes Anderson. I don't know why I was not considered for that Indian guy's part in 'The Grand Budapest Hotel.'I am a little bored of playing negative characters."
53,Jisshu Sengupta,"Both my daughters scold me. I am the youngest in my family.As an actor I can't think of what my daughter will think when she grows up. I will never do certain kinds of roles that I have in my mind. And for that I'm sure my daughters are going to be proud of me.I do more of ensemble casting, roles that are different. In one film I'm playing a villain, in the other I'm playing a son.It's the upbringing at home. You can have education abroad, the best of things, but you can be a horrible human being.I am looking at characters that will stay with people, that they will remember. Characters that are relevant.The top Bengali directors in Bollywood know about me and the work that I have done. I have worked with everyone, from Anurag Basu, Pradeep Sarkar to Shoojit Sircar.I was at a dinner with my family in 2017, end-October, when I got the call. I got to know that 'Manikarnika' was being made and they wanted me to play Gangadhar Rao.I was simultaneously shooting for 'Manikarnika' and 'Ek Je Chhilo Raja'. In two-and-a-half months, I took 23 flights, including an international flight to Los Angeles. It was physically very challenging, shooting for both. I would catch up on sleep on the flights.Look, for every film I change my look.Besides, I never think negative. That is my biggest strength. Even if someone thinks bad about me I wish good for that person. I am not saying I am a super human being but I have always wanted good for people and look where I am today!"
54,John Abraham,"I was slightly disheartened when three of my films didn't work at the box-office. But the silver lining is that people did appreciate my work in those films. Had my performance gone unnoticed, I would've been in big trouble then.My greatest strength as an actor is that I follow my director's brief completely. The film is always the director's visual baby.I don't have a problem being labeled a sex symbol, though I personally don't feel very sexy about myself.I still believe that 'No Smoking' is one of my best performances.I make films from the heart. I want to concentrate on the job of doing great and honest performances, and I'm gonna get better with every performance of mine, with every film of mine."
55,Kabir Bedi,"I'm not the sort to wallow in nostalgia about the good old days.The average Englishman has no idea of the dynamism in the music scene here.Delhi is my emotional home. I still dream of owning a home there.I love the stage, I love the process of acting in theatre, but unfortunately, it doesn't pay the bills.Men are like mascara, they run at the slightest display of emotion.I also said, men are like curling irons, they never get out of your hair. And they are like government bonds, they take so long to mature.You are probably right when you say that I could get a role in any producer's film if I just asked.I have never pressurized a producer to do me any favor.You see, I have many friends in the Hindi film industry.I am going to produce a movie of my own. I am not going to stick to the time-tested formulae of Hindi cinema. I want to make a film for the present generation. So there will be a lot of new faces in the film."
56,Kamal Haasan,"If reality TV is bad, so is Colosseum, so are the gladiators, so are sports. I think cricket is bad. But that's a point of view.I'd like to keep updating myself. That's the only way to make life interesting. And because I am a performer, I like to do it deliberately and with purpose.All my films are statements, especially when I write them.I cannot live on myths; somehow, science convinces me more easily. I am prone to lean towards science, ethics, and philosophy rather than myth, religion, and rituals.There is a buffet of ideologies for me to choose from. I've been a fan of certain communist and socialist ideals. Some have failed, some have succeeded. I've lived long enough to understand where all they failed.Politics is too big a game to feel the absence of a Kamal Haasan.I have been vociferous against government on things like beef. I used to eat beef, but I've stopped. That doesn't mean others shouldn't eat beef.If it doesn't reach the last poor man, your constitution is wrong.Since I was 20, I wanted to make a short film and send it to international short film festivals. It never happened. I became too big a star to indulge in those things.As a principle, I will never react to film criticisms. As long as they are part of film fraternity, whatever they say will be beneficial to cinema."
57,Karan Patel,"I respect people's feelings when they say they love me, but it is completely their choice of expression, and I am alien to it. People have a right to express, but that's it.The funniest memory that I can recall about my school days has to be one incident that involved unfinished homework for numerous days. I didn't do any of my homework for days and days at a stretch, and kept stalling my teacher that I was extremely unwell and was under heavy medication.My fitness instructor helped me with strength training, muscle building, and toning.I do a lot of weight training, and my workouts are intense, which include cardios, core body workouts, and functional training.My diet is high on protein, which keeps me energised and fresh.Adopting this lifestyle and opting to exercise has helped me a lot in life.It is a proud moment for any male actor to have thousands of females chasing you.I am a celebrity, and it feels good to be famous.People are sensible enough to know who's dragging my name in dirt for publicity.Shah Rukh Khan started his career with television, and now he is a superstar. You can't generalise and say that TV actors can't make it to films."
58,Karan Singh Grover,"I am originally a surd who was born in Delhi in 1982, just two years before the Sikh riots, so all my childhood pictures are in baby frocks with ponytails, as my parents wanted to hide the fact that I was a Sikh boy, given the riots. My dad worked for a travel agency, and we soon moved to Saudi Arabia.There are co-ed schools in Saudi, but those are American or British. My dad, of course, believed in the good old CBSE Indian school system and thus, my younger brother Ishmeet and I were put in an all-boys CBSE school. My mother could move out only if she wore a burkha.Both me and Ishmeet were very naughty. We used to have my grandfather's swords in the house. We used to take all these swords and take all the showpieces Mom had and slice them one by one. He actually locked my nana in the kitchen once for two hours.Saudi had been a very restricted place. Even on the magazines there, if there was a little leg or cleavage showing, they used to blacken it with a black mark. Me and Ishmeet, so many times, had tried to remove the black portion with our spit, but of course, it would never come out.My character Saurabh Singhania is a rich, bad guy who is driven by revenge, so much that you feel like scratching his face or throwing stones at him. The intimate scenes in the trailer are creating quite a buzz... I wish they had shown more of the story instead of the sizzling scenes. The film is not about boldness or intimacy.As actors, we need to do our parts exactly the way they have visualised it, because if we don't, we have to keep doing it many times over.Hate is a very strong and heavy emotion, probably as strong as love. I don't think I can live with hatred. If something bad happens, you feel bad about it; you forgive and move on. There's no hatred.Why are we tiptoeing on glass? You can ask me whatever you like; people usually do, and I try to be as honest as I can.If I had my way, I wouldn't be sharing my personal life online. I'm a private person. At home, I don't wander around shirtless, flexing my muscles. I roam around unshaven, with my hair disheveled. Unfortunately, people perceive you differently. It's okay; they're free to speculate.I came to Mumbai in 2000 to do a hotel management course. Following this, I worked as a marketing executive with Hotel Sheraton in Muscat for a year. It was in 2004 that I participated in the Gladrags Mr. India contest and bagged the most popular model award. After that, I did few ramp shows and ads."
59,Karthi,"I loved movies and watched a lot of them. But my father insisted that I get a good education before I joined the film industry.After I did my graduation in mechanical engineering, I got a scholarship to go to the U.S. to do my master's. So I did that. I also worked there for a while. After my master's, I did a course in Film Appreciation.I always knew I wanted to be in films, but I did not know exactly what I wanted to do.I am not a sportsperson. I used to spend all my time in front of a computer.I had to go for physical training for 'Aayirathil Oruvan.' I had to do stunts which required huge leaps.It is a treat to do scenes where you silently enact.I want to travel all over India.I was dying to start shooting for 'Paiyya.' I had worn no good clothes for months, and I was dying to wear good clothes. And, for 'Paiyya,' they gave me eight clothes to change in a day!I must admit, strong films are more interesting to me, as, by the end of the day's shooting, you feel good.I would say I was not working in the real sense in 'Paiyaa.' After doing very heavy scenes in my first two films, in 'Paiya,' I was romancing a girl, talking all sorts of funny things, and doing all light things just as if I were not acting!"
60,Kartik Aaryan,"People relate to my characters and see me in a different way. They identify with me and remember the nuances of my characters.I'm happy being the relatable hero.Life of an actor is not his or hers: it's everyone's life. Nothing is private; nothing is personal. If you're doing great in terms of work, that's the price you've to give.I know my talent when it comes to acting. But will I get the opportunity to showcase? That fear seeps in when an actor's film fail back-to-back.The audience has reacted well to my comic timing. But, I also have other aspects to my acting talent.In the industry, once people see you in a certain mold, you start getting offered only those kind of roles.I am always on the lookout for roles which will help me better myself.I am a greedy actor, and I want the best roles to come my way.As an actor, you're always told that your career needs box-office numbers.In both the 'Punchnama' movies, the characters and their relationships were only about boyfriends and girlfriends. But in 'SKTKS,' we had so much more to talk about."
61,Karunas,"I started off as a mimicry artist, have sung 'Gaana' folk music and popularized pop music in the South before I got into acting.I am not one of those who eats, sleeps and drinks movies.I only want to use my status as a comic actor to bring about a difference to society.I have been in this industry for over a decade, and I still don't consider myself a movie star.I choose movies with caution.If there was one leader liked by people of all sections, it was Pasumpon Muthuramalinga Thevar and after him MGR could get everyone on to his side.I would serve the food for the students in my school and in return I will get some more upma. At times, I would even take the food home.I have acted in more than 100 films so far. And I have worked with almost all top stars and leading directors.I always used to tell others that 'we should make films to make the people happy.'I have fear of the audience and I am responsible for the scenes involving me, be it as a comedian or hero."
62,Kumar Pallana,"I want more job. I want to die entertaining.My father lost his business. Our house was locked up, and we had to leave.To make the people happy, to forget their problems. Then, to me, I'm doing my job. But to act is a God gift.Each of us has our own destiny. Mine is to be an actor.I'm an old guy. I don't hustle and I don't bustle. So sometimes you're behind, but that's okay. Your peace of mind is more important. I have seen the people who hustle and bustle, and they are already gone, at a young age. They could have enjoyed life."
63,Kunal Khemu,"Life was difficult for my family, as we didn't know where to go after leaving Kashmir. We settled down in Mumbai, in a suburb called Mira Road.As a child, I thought we had come to Mumbai for a holiday. I did not realise that this holiday was permanent.If you notice, no child star made it big when s/he grew up because the child's image was still fresh in people's memory. They could not digest the fact that the child star had grown into a man.After Class 10, I kept away from films.When we watch a film as actors, you have to understand that we always see much more than what's on screen.More than the length, it's the meat of the character that is more important. It does not matter if you are on screen, standing in the corner for the whole film, as opposed to doing something that stands out in two scenes.I have had my share of flops and it's very discouraging. It's pathetic to be on that side.I am a person who is greedy to do better in life, to do more in life.You don't want to be wearing tight jeans and a blingy jacket on a 16-hour flight.The only time I travelled solo was when I did a 40-day trip visiting America for the first time."
64,Lavrenti Lopes,"Prejudices and preferences exist and will continue to. When you learn how to market yourself, you become less of a victim.I think I was 8 or 9 when I did my first play. It was at a community level, but that's when I knew that this is what I loved doing.Mumbai is home, so there's no comparison. But then again, New York's a lot like Mumbai, which is why I choose to live there. It's fast, crowded (in a good way), the people are friendly and it's full of color and race, like Mumbai. Unfortunately, the traffic's also just as bad.I come from an everyday middle class family in India. The film industry reached us only through our television sets and cinema halls.As a child I wanted to be everything from a doctor, lawyer, flight attendant to an IT pro- fessional and could never make up my mind. I figured as an actor I'd get to play all these professions.I admire Meryl Streep and Dustin Hoffman for their sheer dedication to their craft.The roles for South Asians may have increased by a decent number but there has been a negligible change in the quality of these roles. We still have to fight stereotypes. Fortunately, I've had the priviledge of working with people who look beyond the color of your skin."
65,Mahesh Babu,"Being a father is the most important thing, if you ask me. It changed me as a person and gave me an all new life.I was 13 - 14 when I first tasted stardom. In the summer holidays, my dad made me act in these films that went on to become superhits. I became a child star.When my film flops, I believe it is my mistake. There have been times when I didn't come out of my house because my films didn't do well. I lock myself in for months. I don't talk to people. I feel bad for producer, director, for those who lost money. It's never about myself or my career alone.Stress and looks are directly connected as far as I am concerned. If you are happy, you look good.Over the years, with all the experience, I've become more mature about the subjects I pick. I have a better understanding of what works at the box office. Once the story is finalised, I surrender to the director and follow him. After that, my performances speak for themselves.The only thing I have learnt over the years is that if you enjoy your work and put in the best efforts, it will show. If you follow this process, things work out. But if you go chasing a formula, success will elude you.I don't have any dream role. I give my 100% to every character I play, and when the film clicks, it automatically becomes a dream role.I always believe that one can't interfere in another's work. Once I start work on any film, I surrender myself completely and blindly follow the director.As long as I am acting, I will do only Telugu films. I want to take Telugu films to the world. Everyone should talk about our films.When I work on a movie, I never aim for records, collections or the number one position. I always concentrate on my work and look for ways to improve my acting abilities. I also advise my co-stars not to concentrate on these pretty issues and just focus on acting."
66,Mammootty,"There are times when you get several great, exciting roles; there are times when you don't.Everyone has ups and downs. You can't always get exciting roles.I don't consider any film of mine bad. I give all my films the importance they deserve. I look at all my roles with the same kind of seriousness.A product can turn bad, not the production. When you start a film, you feel it will be great. But sometimes, as it progresses, it fails somewhere. You can't blame anyone for that. You can blame only your own intelligence!Emotions are the same to all human beings. But there is some difference in the way people react to situations.I am an Indian, and I know what India is. I know Indian culture. I know Indian constitution and democracy.When the medium of the film is English, even the illiterates also should speak in proper English.The producers came across some of my photographs. They thought that I resembled Ambedkar closely. So they invited me.There were no clippings of Ambedkar. The only thing I had was a two-and-a-half minute film which I saw countless times. Nobody knows how he walked, how he spoke, or how he behaved. I had to conceive all those things in my mind. I had to work a lot on the make-up, too.I am a professional actor, and I am very careful about being sincere to the characters I play."
67,Manivannan,"It was sheer coincidence that 'Amaidhi Padai' had an open-ended climax. The idea for a sequel kept coming up, and I decided to act on it, nearly 20 years after the first film. It was not a planned decision.There's satisfaction and contentment in direction.Some theatres back home used to screen arthouse films by Adoor and Shyam Benegal, and week-long festivals of films from France, Germany and the U.S.S.R. That was when I realised there was a world where people did not run around trees singing duets. That it was possible to make a different kind of cinema.Once you achieve success, you are consumed by the fear of living up to it. Which is why many directors stick to tried and tested fare. But, I made films on village subjects, love stories, movies with students as focus, crime thrillers... it was very satisfying.When it's a superstar's movie, it does not matter whether I am a villain, comedian or father. Acting in such movies is always good and special."
68,Manoj Bajpayee,"I had to either get better or leave the field. I couldn't go back to my village as a failure. The only thing that occurred to me was that I would work hard and get better next year. I feel that my love for the craft has got me this far, and this love is still there.I think theatre is an actor's medium, while cinema is a director's medium.The 10 years of theatre prepared me not only as an actor but also as a human being. It gave me the habit of reading, watching, and preserving.Earlier films were meant only for entertainment, but now filmmakers, who are products of these times, do not compromise on real stuff. That is why storytelling has become more convincing.In 'Queen,' songs were the part of events happening in the story, and that is where we enjoy music. We dance at weddings, we lip sync at bars and discos, and there are special moments in life which need background music. It should be depicted in films in the same way.When I came to industry, theatre persons were regarded as those people who will only ask questions and will be an annoying factor on the set, and there was no preference given to them.I work for the director, and if audience are happy, I have gotten my award. After that, I have to move on.That's realism: a fact that if the audiences don't move out and watch good films at the theatre, people will stop making them.Talent alone doesn't matter in this industry, and everyone knows this. If someone says, 'Good films are done', 'Talent always survives', there are other factors, too, which are far more important.For me, life is starting every day, every year. There's a lot to be done!"
69,Mithun Chakraborty,"I have maintained a low profile throughout my career but have always done things in my own unique way, be it dancing or dressing up. On the dance floor, I had my own unique steps and often had to lead my choreographer.My fans know me and love me the way I am. I don't want to lie to my fans.My fan following is intact. They only like to see me in movies, which I am still doing for them. I do not need to do any long interviews or chat shows.I came into the industry as an actor. And moved on to become a star with the help of my dancing skills.My son is a better dancer than me. I always try to encourage him in his endeavours.I would like to produce films, but I feel I am an unsuccessful producer. That's the fact.Film line is all about chance. I don't think much, I just like to take chances.The success of the film should depend on its budget.I like Hrithik Roshan and Shahid Kapoor. They are amazing and very hard working when it comes to dance.Many Hindi films that are Tamil remakes rake in huge moolah in Bollywood."
70,Mohanlal,"There is no big problem in the Malayalam industry. You shouldn't think of the #MeToo as a movement, actually. It is a fad, and it is turning into something of a fashion. Anything like that will have a lifespan for a bit.Kunjali Marakkar is one of the first naval commanders of Kerala. He was an expert at his craft.I own a couple of restaurants in places like Dubai and Sharjah.Just like films, food is also a passion for me.Cinema is an art form, a result of dedication of a number of people.All my success belongs to those who have contributed in my pursuit of art, ranging from writers and directors to makeup artists, lighting crew, etc.I know it's a craze in Bollywood to have six-pack abs, but here, it's not the abs or the biceps that make us feel or look macho. Down south, the moustache still works for us!I liked the concept of 'Lucifer.''Oppam' is more of a director's movie, especially because I play a visually-challenged hero in it. The character doesn't have a perspective, and so cameras aren't placed like how they are usually done in other movies. The angles and the way the scenes are captured are different.We tend to have so many more close shots, which compels an artist to actually put in more effort than it is required otherwise. So, it is the expressions on the face, and how an actor presents his or her character, that really makes a scene. In such ways, Mollywood is a fabulous training ground for actors and actresses from other industries."
71,Mukesh Tiwari,"It hardly matters for me whether the role is comic or a serious one.For me, what is more important is the challenge the character poses for me as an actor.I am not a comedian.Perception towards Indian television has changed in past few years. It is no more such a small screen, in fact it has wider audience and we should admire it.I've always played negative roles because I think I'm better suited for them.I don't know about anyone else, but I got really scared looking at myself in the mirror when I got my hair cut for a role.I usually get a lot of compliments from people as they can't believe I'm the same person when they meet me.The children in my building don't know my real name! They are so fascinated with my 'Wasooli' look that they call me Wasooli Uncle.I learnt a thing or two about acting from theatre actor Robin Das who is from Odisha.I have done regional films before. They have a different flavour and promising future."
72,"N. T. Rama Rao, Jr.","I love being called NTR's grandson. I never moved away from his shadow, maybe because I didn't try enough or maybe because I like it this way.I believe in doing what I am best at.I don't want to waste my energy in other things; instead, I would put all that in reaching the next level in a craft that I love the most.I am a very shy person who is just close to himself. So I would refrain from talking about my personal life.I have been a very 'hyper boy' right from childhood. And while many liked that trait of mine, my friends didn't.During the early stages of our married life, Pranathi did struggle to adjust for a few months. But she is a very strong woman mentally, stronger than me.I am a typical Telugu boy dominated by all the qualities of a Hyderabadi because I was born and brought up here.Whenever I am stressed, I cook a good meal for my wife. Many people don't know this, but I'm actually a great cook.I've been given the opportunity to carry forward the legacy with which people associate me; I can't escape it even if I don't like it. I take pride in carrying forward what's been given to me.I was meant to be an actor, and I realised that only after my son was born."
73,Naga Chaitanya,"My mother was very strict, and though I was reserved, I did give in to certain demands of my age, like sneaking out of the house to hit Dublin.My father's only advice is to 'do what makes you happy,' and I follow it religiously.'Premam' moved me; it was almost like seeing life play out on screen.My holidays in Hyderabad would be spent on films sets visiting my father and uncle, or in the studios; I was gradually drawn to films.My father always watches my films and gives his opinion. I am even ready to reshoot at times if he asks me to.'Sailaja Reddy Alludu' bears similarity to my father's film 'Allari Alludu,' and it's a fun family entertainer.I believe in films that have logic behind every emotion or action.In most Telugu families, marriage is a union of two families, and 'Rarandoi Veduka Chuddam' presents conflicts from that aspect.I have no qualms approaching directors who I know will help me grow as an actor.I want to make every film different from my previous one."
74,Nana Patekar,"I am a better cook than actor.Cooking is like doing yoga. There is a lot of satisfaction in cooking food for others.My cooking style is exactly like my mother's.My mother is a very strong woman. We were seven kids; five of them passed away. My elder brother and I are alive. My mother lost five kids, her husband, her parents and siblings. But she is so strong, she is living for the people who are alive.I always do one film at a time.I would have loved to work with Satyajit Ray.I wouldn't say I have a bad temper.Bipasha is a very sincere and professional actor.That is my style. I work when I feel like working.When you serve the country selflessly, that is your greatest contribution to the country."
75,Naseeruddin Shah,"I can say with pride that I have a brother who served with distinction in the Indian Army.I have the highest regard for the police forces.I feel anxious for my children because tomorrow, if a mob surrounds them and asks, 'Are you a Hindu or a Muslim?' they will have no answer.I had decided never to dye my hair because by doing that, it doesn't make a man look young. In fact, I feel the wrinkles on a man's face become more prominent when you dye your hair.I am the king of old school romance.I had many doubts while writing my autobiography. I wasn't sure if anyone would be interested to read about my life.A person takes his own path. My father tried to guide me the best way he thought I should go, and it didn't work. I went the way I wanted to.I was lucky to land up in Mumbai when serious cinema was just beginning to flower.One would marvel on the screen the way Shammi Kapoor walked, Dilip Kumar cried, or seeing Dev Anand's style. And then, one day, you are in the same space with them. It's very unreal.When I see an emotion being enacted by a great actor, I always feel I can never do that."
76,Nawazuddin Siddiqui,"I am from a family of farmers from Budhana near Muzaffarnagar.When I had no money, I would find out which friend had work and money at that point in time and would go and stay with him for a week. All of us theatre guys did that.Even though I hated doing farming and wanted to just get out of the village, I would work from 5 in the morning till 5 in the evening.There was electricity in our village only for 2-3 hours a day, so all my life, I studied under a lamp.Behind every easy role, there is a lot of hard work that goes in.It's very difficult switching over from one character to another.'Freaky Ali' may look like an easy role to others, but it is not easy.For me, as an actor, there is no commercial or independent or art cinema. For me, it's a character that is given by the director. And it is a task for me that I have to fulfill it to the best of my ability regardless of the kind of film that it is.I still can't believe it when people say I am a celebrity.Being a recognised face has its problems. I miss the freedom to go anywhere I want to."
77,Neil Nitin Mukesh,"Music is something that I've been passionate about. I play the piano and sing, but I always knew that it was never going to be my bread and butter. I was very interested in acting.When a film doesn't do well, people start doubting you as an actor.I am simple and an open book. I don't like ambitious and materialistic people.I don't believe in rebound relationships and happy sex. Everything has to happen with dignity.Creativity has no boundaries.I don't see myself doing slapstick movies or being a part of them, even if they get the box office ringing. It's not my space; I haven't reached that point.I always put myself in the audience's place and see if, as a viewer, I would want to see the film. If yes, then I want to know who's directing it, what my character is, and if it's impactful. If all these points fall in place, I'll do the film. If not, then I won't think twice before saying no.I think nothing's better than lots of water and a good night's sleep to rejuvenate yourself.'Game of Thrones' is one of my favourite series.My mom once told me that she wants to be born as my girlfriend in the next birth because she sees me how I am, I am extremely expressive, and she loves me for that."
78,Nivin Pauly,"Honestly, I always wanted to be a star. It's a dream.If a film becomes successful, the actor is blamed for being commercial and not having a true love for movies. When we do serious films, we will be blamed for not planning our career properly. I believe that what one should do is to make good cinema and try to make it successful.Like any other actor, I want to work with good directors, and I always look for good scripts. I've had to say no to some people; I suspect that's the reason I'm called arrogant.I don't think I have reached that stage where I can evaluate my career. I still have a long way to go. All I wish for now is to make sensible moves and to choose wisely. It doesn't matter if there are gaps between films, as long as the ones I do give me the satisfaction of having done something good.I don't want to adhere to any particular image. I have tried to bring in variety to my characters. But then, only a few actors have managed to earn this tag of a romantic hero. Many have aspired to get such a label. So I am not complaining.When you are successful, there is this tendency to repeat the elements that we believe have worked in a certain film. Then it becomes formulaic, and there is no getting back.I don't do many films at the same time, as I don't like to switch between characters. At a given point, I would like to get into the skin of whatever character I am playing.I have been doing a lot of romantic movies, so such roles don't excite me much now. I would like to play an out-and-out, really cruel villain once. My character in 'Da Thadiya' had such a streak, but I want a full length villainous role. It is a different kind of excitement.My wife knows that interacting with actresses is all part of the job, but there is a line which I'm not supposed to cross, and as long as I don't cross it, there are no problems. She doesn't bother with whatever I do onscreen. But the line is always there!I am happy being an actor. Donning the hat of a producer was a tough job and a different experience, as it involved watching the crew's requirements, keeping track of the finances, and also perfecting my role as an actor. But it was a tremendous learning experience."
79,Om Puri,"It is my first preference to do films with social significance. Art cinema has given me credibility and status as an actor, but commercial cinema has given me a comfortable living.I prefer working in good cinema, wherever it is. I like subjects that have a universal appeal.What Bollywood lacks is scripts. A lot of the films are copies of western films.When I was at school, I wanted to join the army. At college, I started acting in college plays, and it became a kind of addiction. I was very shy when I was at school, but the plays seemed to give voice to my feelings.I had hoped when my life was chronicled, it would be an inspirational story.When Nandita expressed a desire to write about me, I couldn't stop her because she's my wife, but she has forgotten who she is.Parallel cinema has not made an effort to communicate in a language the other person understands.Actors are just soldiers who follow commands.I have been in the film industry for 35 years, and everyone, including the spot-boys, will vouch for my character.I don't spend on expensive brands. I don't need foreign holidays."
80,Pankaj Tripathi,"I did not become an actor to earn money - that I could have done it in my village by becoming a farmer. I wanted to show my craft, which I am so passionate about.I had never thought that so many people would know me, will talk about me, and most of all, I will be given a National Award.One mistake and all this attention may just disappear one fine day. So I prefer to remain grounded.My wife used to work as a teacher and support me, and now I can do something for her, which is very satisfying for me.We used to live in a rented house in Mumbai, and now we live in our own house. That, for me, is success.Commercial films give you a wide exposure. For 'Dilwale,' I got calls from countries like Oman. Its reach is huge. Similarly, doing independent projects satisfy the actor in you.'Newton' is a black comedy, a social satire. Amit Masurkar is directing the movie, and Drishyam films is producing. Rajkummar Rao is in the movie. I am playing a very important character. It is a very interesting project.'Masaan' was a small role, but people connected with it. I loved playing a man who does not have many complexities in life. I was inspired by my father for this role. You find such characters in novel or in stories. You don't find such parts in movies where characters are either good, bad, or grey.I am happy with my career.I am still a villager who fell in love with acting."
81,Paresh Rawal,"Whatever I want to do or say, I get to do it on the silver screen, so in normal life I don't feel the necessity to do or say anything.Films are meant for the masses, for the purpose of entertainment.I would loved to be called a character actor.Criticism is okay from people who know the finer points of cinema.I enjoy doing all types of role, small or big.Firoz Nadiadwala is a close friend; he was the first person who asked me to direct a film for him. I would like to have him as my producer for my directorial debut.Except theatre, there is no medium which can satisfy good artistes in India.I do theatre for my personal satisfaction and enjoyment.I do enjoy cricket, but the game is over hyped.Just because good films don't work does not mean we should stop making them."
82,Pawan Kalyan,"I have always wanted to be a gardener, and I love the time I spend in my garden.I have been a depressed kid. I wanted to lead a quiet life, never wanted to be an actor.Nature, philosophy and social issues are the three things that always occupy my mind. You do not have any power over others but can only change yourself.If I do not respond to some situation, my conscience kills me. I believe in permissible violence, not necessarily non-violence.I never wanted to become an actor. I always wanted to be a farmer and dreamt of owning half an acre of agriculture land.It's destiny that pushed me towards showbiz. I wanted to start off as a technician, but out of compulsion, I became an actor.Many will call me an adventurer, and that I am, only one of a different sort: one of those who risks his skin to prove his platitudes.The revolution is not an apple that falls when it is ripe. You have to make it fall.I'm Indian. I care for our Motherland.There is a latent talent in everyone. I am nothing extraordinary just because I happen to be an actor. Everybody is extraordinary in his own way. One must identify one's own talent early on - one is not great merely when he gets recognized by others - and one doesn't become a nobody just because his talent is not widely known."
83,Prabhas,"I was the laziest person around. Suddenly, one day, I decided to become an actor. Thank God for that whimsical decision: else, by now, I'd have been a 140-kilo, butter-chicken-bingeing hotelier.I was just lucky to be a part of this phenomenon of Indian cinema. Perhaps no other film can ever match the magic and awe of 'Baahubali.'I watch a lot of Hindi films. I live in Hyderabad, where 60 per cent of the people speak Hindi.I made a good association with Karan Johar. If I want anything, I think I can ask him. He has helped us a lot.In Hollywood, the guy who plays Batman and Spiderman also plays normal characters. The biggest stars in the world want to play different characters. We can't give the excuse that because an actor played a superhero in his previous film, his next one won't work.If the script is not good, the film will not work.People recognise me from all over the country, which we didn't expect.Dubbing for myself in Hindi is a big task. I know Hindi. I can read and write Hindi, but I dont normally speak the language, and that is very important.I want my films to be entertaining: not comedy, but something which is gripping.I still have that South Indian accent. But I am working on it. Hindi audiences should feel that I am speaking like them and should relate to me."
84,Prakash Raj,"Politics is a conversation between the contestant and the voter.You are not electing your parliamentarian or your MP to the corridors of power. You are electing them to the corridors of responsibility.Everybody has their manifesto; let them talk their language, come to the people, and the people will decide. In a democracy, no party or candidate wins or loses. If you, the people, chose a wrong man, you lose; if you chose the right one, you win.To be known as an actor is to be known for your role and lines. But the country knows me for the stance I have taken, for the villages I have adopted, the social work I do, the comfort zone I have left.I'm responsible for what I say, and that is the identity for Prakash Raj.When I help a farmer, I don't differentiate between them based on their region, as farmers have no borders. I want to live like a world citizen and react like a human being.People know me as Prakash Rai in Karnataka. Let it be so. But I'm known as Prakash Raj to the rest of India and abroad. Every actor worth his salt gets a name after coming to films.In the Constitution, there is no idea of a political party. It is representatives of every constituency because it is so vibrant and varied.Majoritarian is when a majority takes a decision. It is not dictatorship. It is about which issue is major.A job is a person's identity in a society, his way of living, and his relevance in society."
85,Prateik Babbar,"We, as a society, need to be open-minded.The biases in our society stems from the orthodox mentality. It is very deep-rooted in our country but we need to wake up.There are too many different kinds of people in this world. Not just drags or gays, everybody is different from each other. We should proudly own our individuality.I was always aware Mom was someone who was recognised, admired and loved.I know I must be true to myself.I have no choice but give my best, even if it is a small role. There are a lot of expectations from the family and industry.My grandparents and my aunts tell me that I need to make a name for myself like my mother. Their thoughts really motivate me.It is not about being a hero or a villain; I want to be a solid and passionate actor.I don't want to limit myself as an actor.Life is nothing without ups and downs."
86,Prithviraj Sukumaran,"We have always wanted to give back to cinema, and we couldn't possibly think of a better way to do that than facilitate films which we believe will make Malayalam cinema proud.Since I'm serious about a career in Hindi films, I'd have relocate to Mumbai.Though Suparna is a Malayali, she has spent a large part of her life in Mumbai. She's a Mumbai girl. In fact, I saw the real Mumbai through Suparna's eyes. Of course, I knew Mumbai before I got to know Suparna. But it was Suparna who showed me sides to Mumbai I had never seen.I am in no rush to get anywhere.I can read and write in Hindi.'Aurangzeb' for me is a right film, as there is action and drama.We were shooting for 'Aiyyaa' in Yash Raj studios, and I got an offer for 'Aurangzeb.' That's the only time I went for an audition.If people say Rani Mukerji recommended me, than I have no issue. If someone says that, then I enjoy that kind of news. I don't mind people writing such stories.I never went and searched for a Bollywood film. It just happened naturally... it was a natural course.'Aiyyaa' was not the first film that I was offered in Hindi... it was the first film that I wanted to do in Hindi."
87,Prosenjit Chatterjee,"I don't have a fixed fitness regime, as everything depends on my work schedule and my fitness instructor. But I make sure that I work out 365 days a year for at least one and a half hours, no matter what.Well, being fit is not about flaunting muscles or biceps. Being fit is about flexibility and fit is about flexibility and body composition.I take eight meals a day.Working out, for me, is like brushing my teeth. So, I can't cheat on that.I have not planned my Bollywood career the way I have planned my career in Bengali films.I was never serious about Bollywood films, but when I was offered a film like 'Shanghai,' I took it because it is a good film.In my Bengali films, I am involved with all the promotional activities, release date posters etc.I love to prepare for my roles.The memories of shooting in Iceland are amazing.For me, it was more challenging to become Netaji, as I don't have the same physical built or look like him."
88,R. Madhavan,"'Tanu Weds Manu's brilliance lies in the fact that it makes the middle class want to be aspirational.I eat exactly three times a day: breakfast, lunch and dinner. I sit quietly for 20 minutes without anybody disturbing me, and I chew each mouthful 60 times.I have found out what I am allergic to, and I am trying to avoid that in my daily food intake.I don't have anything fresh in terms of raw foods or salad after 4 P.M. And no food after 7 P.M.I eat before I feel hungry. I know that when you order food or shop on an empty stomach, you always tend to over-eat, over-order, or over-shop. So I always eat slightly before I'm famished.I value my independence a lot, and the thought of having to lose that due to age or any other reason terrifies me.I might sound audacious, but the Mahatma has been a great inspiration. He had the conviction to live with his beliefs in the face of total disbelief.Oh, I have very limited will power. I wish I could change that. I am working on it, though. I am too easygoing.I dislike the trait of ungratefulness.If I could, I would like my son to study in Jamshedpur, where I did my schooling."
89,Rahul Dev,"I can't be the villain that I play in the movies.I was the first guy from a modelling background to successfully venture into films.It's fantastic to be associated with television.When I look at character artistes, they begin after 40. For instance, Boman Irani took up his first film after he was 40. Since I too, am in my 40s, I think I am finally getting to be in my zone.If you look around, 90 percent of marriages are cliches - people aren't genuinely happy even if they look happy together.I was nominated as one of the most promising entrepreneurs by a business magazine a long time back. I worked in Telco way back in 1993 and then started my leather business.A film career is a natural progression for any model and i'm sure this trend will continue.In many households today, the woman is also a bread winner and with this financial independence comes the power of making choices.To be successful in Bollywood, one needs a certain body type.One of the biggest lessons I've learnt is patience. It's critical when raising a child."
90,Raj Kapoor,"A woman always has her man, but the man unconsciously leans on his roots, his heritage. He feels like an orphan without his parents.I think we brothers realised his loss more and more as we grew older. We actually grew closer after his death.I've struggled a lot for what I have today.Once, he was chosen to play Ram in a small Ramleela company, but his parents were against it."
91,Rajesh Khattar,"I am extremely frustrated with my son Ishaan Khattar being referred to as 'Kapur' time and again in the media. I am anguished and feel helpless.For me, becoming a father at 50-plus was another challenge, but then, I am neither the first one, nor the last in this category.I would never give a piece of advice whether it is a personal or professional one as I don't believe in it.After a time, all children have to be on their own. Though as parents you always want to cushion them, however, when life throws new challenges, they have to take their own calls.A lot of nepotism that exists, actually, exists outside this industry because in this industry, behind the camera a director's son becomes a director and a producer's son becomes a producer and that is still understandable that they are carrying their legacy but for actors, it is very very different.Like I say, every child is born with his or her destiny; what he does with it is what matters.After acting for four years, in five languages, theatre became my stepping stone to TV and cinema.I was fortunate enough to work with legends like Hrishikesh Mukherjee, Basu Chatterjee, Vijay Anand and Yash Chopra, and contemporary filmmakers like Farhan Akhtar and Karan Johar.While acting with Amitabh Bachchan, the legend of Hindi cinema, and superstars like Shah Rukh Khan, Ajay Devgn and Akshay Kumar, I observed how they interpret cinema and make it an experience to cherish for their audiences.My son Ishaan's passion for movies and his exposure to world cinema infuses me with optimism."
92,Rajinikanth,"I used to have a private... life. Now I dont have that... I have no freedom. I miss my normal life terribly. Its a prison-like life I'm leading.God gave me an actor's role; I have done that well. God gave me now a political role, and I am 100 per cent sure I will perform that well.By God's grace, the only property my parents gave me was a good body. No BP, no sugar, no hereditary problems. Small build, tight skin.If I get a good character, a suitable role, a good producer-director, only then will I do a film.I go to the Himalayas after every film. I go alone. I go to the interiors, to the villages. Being there itself is like meditation.To ride two horses at the same time is difficult.They say not everyone can be MGR. I agree. MGR is a revolutionary. Not in a 1,000 years can there be another MGR. If anyone says he will be the next MGR, he is insane. But I have the confidence that I can give the government that MGR gave to the people of Tamil Nadu.It is not right to play politics with education.Due to God's grace and a good director, I became successful.Everyone's amazed by the question that how did I succeed as an actor in the industry, which has Kamal Haasan? It's because I grew as an actor watching Kamal's acting."
93,Rajkummar Rao,"No, nothing much has changed in me as an actor. Since the day I started out, I always wanted to be part of good stories. The only thing that has changed is now I have options of good stories to choose from.A film like 'Kai Po Che!', 'Queen', 'Behen Hogi Teri' and 'Bareilly Ki Barfi' are not really independent films.I want to work with Darren Aronofsky, Damien Chazelle, Alejandro Gonzalez Inarritu and, of course, Majid Majidi.It's very tough for someone who doesn't have a filmi background to get work in Bollywood. It's not a smooth ride unless you are really lucky. But I think one has to be prepared for that.I don't know how my body would react if I don't eat for 10 days. In order to go through that experience, I almost did not eat or drink water for 15-20 days. I only had one carrot a day, a cup of black coffee, and a few sips of water.When I was in Class Four, I wanted to be an astronaut. I am still fascinated with the universe. I decided I wanted to be an actor when I was in Class Eight.After my schooling, I started theatre. By the time I graduated, I was doing theatre 24x7. Luckily, the FTII (Film and Television Institute of India) acting course started.People will invest in you only if they see some kind of return, and that's the dark truth.I feel since people have started noticing me and enjoying my performance, and considering the kind of love I've got in 2017-18, many feel that I have arrived, because there's a belief that I can probably carry a film on my shoulders now.I want to keep running. I don't ever want this journey to finish. And for that to happen, you can't put too much of your brain in doing things and can't connect too many dots because, anyway, there is no guarantee of anything."
94,Ram Charan,"My father is a big fan of Amitabh Bachchan and always wanted to work or star in a remake of any of his film. But he didn't get the opportunity.Nobody can be like Mr. Bachchan.Better a decent remake than a bad original, don't you think?We have to understand that content is king now. And it doesn't matter what the source of the content and where it's coming from, as long as it is workable.It is no longer important for me to be seen in every frame.I know my fans want me on the screen. But I think hero-worship should not be allowed to corrupt the plot and narrative of a film.I don't think 'Magadheera' should be remade, nor do I think it will be remade. It is very difficult to recreate the same magic.'3 Idiots' was remade in various languages down south, but it wasn't successful anywhere because the magic was created by Aamir Khan and Rajkumar Hirani.Some films shouldn't be remade.When I decided to work with Krishna Vamsi, people around me were apprehensive about my decision. They warned me that I shouldn't work with an unsuccessful director."
95,Ram Kapoor,"Platinum for me signifies everlasting love, which needs to be celebrated in the most special way.I enjoy all kinds of performances and take each role differently. I keep the audiences in mind.I love the process of acting, and to turn your passion into a career is the biggest gift.I think you have to be really lucky to pick the sort of roles you want to do.My dad is extremely successful, so I've seen the money and luxury growing up. I'm nowhere close to his stature.You can't take yourself too seriously; it's important to poke fun at yourself. Once in a while, it is great to show your inadequacies, too.You won't believe it, but for the first two years of our marriage I lived off my wife. Like every self-respecting man, I hated it.No one wants to work with a difficult star. I want to be the nice guy.Television has done a lot for me, and I can never stay away from it.When you do good work, people will notice you."
96,Rana Daggubati,"It's awesome that we can make more and more movies that are crossing boundaries.We see many posters and standees at cinema halls, and some catch attention. But these posters are soon forgotten. Taking a picture with the actors, enabled by AR, helps record a memory.Over time, I decided to take up only those stories I love.I didn't set out to be a regular hero.Give me something new, and I'll do it with all my heart.Not all stories are meant for the big screen.Social media is just a platform. What some people decide to do with it results in something good or bad.Every story has a place where it deserves to be told.While we were shooting 'Baahubali,' I had a knee injury, and a few months later, Prabhas injured his shoulder. Those two injuries meant a break of around five months from the schedule. So around that time, I was doing absolutely nothing, and Neeraj Pandey called me with 'Baby.'I want to do films that are genre-based and character-based."
97,Ranbir Kapoor,"Today, the paparazzi are not just photographers: everyone has a cell phone with a camera. If they see an actor, they click pictures to show it to their friends or have it on their phones and, as an actor, I don't see anything wrong with it. Having said that, there is a limit that has been crossed, but there is nothing right or wrong.What really matters is your movies and how good a person you are. Otherwise, tabloids and news channels writing about you only builds your curiosity and stardom and propels you to reach wider places.It's not that I am not emotional, but I am extremely secure and curb it, as I am afraid to let go and be broken. So, I have cultivated myself to be detached in life, specially where movies are concerned.I truly believe that God has given us few brain cells, and you have to direct them to the right things that make you happy.I think I've found a purpose in acting; it's something I truly love and truly enjoy. It makes me happy. It makes me understand more about life, in front of the camera, than what I'm living beyond the camera.I'm quite detached from failure and success. Once a shooting is done, I kind of close that chapter in my life.Happiness exists only if you have a lot of people to share it with.I'm not being really intelligent in my film choices; I'm just landing the opportunity when it comes.I don't think I can speak of the achievements of Indian cinema because it's so large next to me. It's not stopping. It's ever-growing. We are going towards the right direction. We are evolving as a filmmaking industry as actors, directors, producers, singers, musicians. Everybody just pushing the boundaries.At the end, it's your movie and your performance that stands out. So if I am a good actor, and if am being part of good entertaining engaging films, audiences will like me."
98,Randeep Hooda,"I never think about what others are doing. I do a film for myself, not others.I have this soft spot for have-nots. So, I was really inclined to portray their pain and pathos in 'Highway.'I would really love to work with Clint Eastwood.I used to run away from school to my village. But later, I went to the U.S. for studies and lost touch.I would often take this bus and go to a nearby village where I had hordes of animal friends. I was hardly around four or five years old then. The conductor was so used to seeing me hop on to the bus and get down at the same place, that he never asked any questions. The strangest part is, he never asked for a ticket either!Honestly, I find writing to be a very lonely job.From being a waiter, to a door-to-door salesman, to a car-washer, to a delivery boy - I have done it all.I find solace in animals. I have got a stray dog at home called Candy. I picked it up while I was waiting at the airport one day. I always wanted to have a 'macho' dog but got this sweet little thing instead.In all of us, there is a struggle between the good and the bad. It makes it more palpable and real to play such people as an actor.I feel very meditative when I ride. A horse does not know whether my movie is a hit or a flop or what is happening in my relationship."
99,Ranjeet,"I have lived life on my own terms.I did not have a godfather.I can say that I have lived very gracefully.Work is work for me. I can do any work in the field of acting. Be it films, television or theatre, I am willing to do anything.I was born in in Amritsar, the eldest of the four siblings.My father Dwarakaprasad Bedi had an electrical accessories factory in Delhi.Growing up, I played soccer and wanted to be a sportsman.During the mid-1980s, I felt my work was getting monotonous. I was shooting continuously, sometimes for 25, 30 films at a time.I wasn't good-looking like the heroes. But I had a good physique having been a goalkeeper. I was like a panther.Every woman is possessive though she may not show it."
100,Ranveer Singh,"I always wanted to be an actor ever since I was a little kid. I knew that I had to do something related to performing arts, and I enjoyed acting the most as it incorporated so many different art forms.I must say, I was a very filmy kid. I used to watch a lot of TV and get very influenced by Bollywood.My ambition was always to bag a lead role in a film, and hence, I refrained from doing any ads, TV serials, music videos, as I felt that a fresh face always works much better. It was a gamble, and I took that gamble telling myself that I will give it my all to bag a lead role.I just stick to my job, which is acting. Things like posters, publicity material, and promotions are entirely the film-maker's prerogative. I don't get into all of that.Let me put it this way: if I am the leading man of the film, and the film-maker is asking me to support him in a certain aspect so as not to burden the budget of the film, I will do whatever I can to support his vision.I treat all women with the utmost respect both professionally and personally and would never do anything to disrespect them.Ever since I was a little kid, the only thing that fascinated me, excited me, and engaged me was Hindi films. I didn't know anything beyond Hindi films. I was a 'filmi bachcha.'I just love being in front of the camera making people laugh, cry, entertaining them. It's the 'nasha' of performance that I enjoy. It's my calling, and I'm blessed to be able to do that for a living.When I was launched in 2010, people told me that I wasn't the best looking guy, so I would have to act really well. I am aware that I am not conventionally good looking. I have heard it so many times that I have started believing it.I have grown up believing that when an individual excels at what he does, it makes him desirable. I am a living example that lack of conventional good looks shouldn't hinder you from being awesome."
101,Ravi Teja,"I just trust the director and never overanalyse the script, screenplay, etc. You are just taking a bet at the end of the day, so confidence, be it on the filmmaker or the script, is all that counts.We all do films believing in them completely, but sometimes, the audiences like what we like, and other times, they don't.I can't work with people who aren't fun loving. I don't encourage such people.I'm shy by nature and don't like talking about myself, and would let my films do the talking.I experimented with different roles, but they didn't work, despite being fantastic films like 'Naa Autograph,' 'Sambo Siva Sambo,' 'Neninthe'... etc. I was very satisfied doing those roles. Had those films worked for me, I perhaps would not have tried anything different further. I like to experiment once in a while if it works.I haven't got an opportunity to experiment with the dimensions of my moustache much. But yes, if the role demands, I'm ready to shave it off. I feel it's good to have moustaches for South films, but I'd love to remove my moustache; why not?Comparison is a disease. I never felt any competition, since I never compared myself to others. I only focus on my work. I never feel pressurised and do films in my style. Also, I'm very active since childhood, and that gives me the edge to always put my best.Lot of work can be completed by 7 A.M.; people who wake up at 10 and 11 don't know what they are missing.I seek speed, clarity, and a practical approach in people I mingle and work with. I can't see myself working in films that stretch beyond maximum four months.I cannot handle dull, lazy, morose people. I have been like that since childhood."
102,Rishi Kapoor,"Beef is not allowed in my house.If our Hindu culture forbids beef meat, does the same culture give you the right to abuse me and my family just because I have an opinion that you don't agree with?I respect religious rules. I am a true God-fearing Hindu.I am not advocating beef eating. But I am advocating freedom to have an opinion and a voice.If you want rubbish, you will get rubbish.It was a stroke of luck when I worked in 'Agneepath.' It was a great role, something different for me.I have tried to look different and play different roles through my life because I am passionate about my work.My first love is acting, not directing.My entire family has been part of the film industry for many years.There are ups and downs in every relationship. But that does not mean that couples should separate or get down to inhuman behaviour."
103,Riteish Deshmukh,"I think any kind of comic sequence is as easy and as difficult as it is written. So, if it is written well, then it becomes easy. Sometimes you find it difficult because the humour is not coming out.The beauty of a relationship is when you get used to a person; it is not sudden. It is just a process, and you don't realise when love happens.I didn't know how it was to be a bachelor. I never felt like one. I think it's a mental state.Acting has been my first passion, and turning a producer was a natural progression.It's such a lovely feeling to be in love, to marry the person you love and finally to be with that person. I feel the romance should never go out of any marriage. Even after one has had kids, etc. Love never ends, na?Life itself has so much politics, why should I make it my profession? I'm just a politician's son, not a politician myself. Two politicians, that's my dad and elder brother, in the family are enough. I'm happy doing my own stuff in Bollywood.I like to watch films with my wife and friends. That's how films should be watched. Only then can you enjoy the movies. Then whether it is raunchy or not, hardly matters.I just can't resist mutton biryani. It's something I've loved eating as a child too. Whenever I'm feeling low, I just pep myself with some good biryani.I love to watch movies and play cricket.When it comes to politics, there's never a certain yes or no to any situation."
104,Rithvik Dhanjani,"Love is everything for me. It's the way of life. It's the way of expressing and way of breathing for me.Love is not just about love for your girlfriend, boyfriend, husband, or wife. Love, for me, is the love for my work, family, and even friends. The emotion is very strong. It comes with a lot of responsibilities.I've been always clear that I wouldn't do TV soaps just for the sake of doing them. I would rather wait and work on projects which enable me to make an impact.One of the major things in any dance-based reality show is how smartly you can impress the audience and keep your cool throughout the show.'Bigg Boss' is one show that I can never be a part of. I am very restless as a person, so keeping me locked won't be a good idea.I believe that a web series allows actors the freedom to express their views.I think I have balanced hosting and acting pretty well.As an actor, I feel there isn't much to explore on TV. So, if I get better work as a host, why wouldn't I do it?The only pressure you put on yourself is the one you want to. No one else can pressurise you.I am all for TV, but I want to be part of shows that stand out."
105,Rohan Chand,"I really want to work with Hugh Jackman and also Steven Spielberg.I really want to do a sci-fi movie.My dad said that if it's part of the character, I'm allowed to say bad words, but if it's not part of the character, and I say it at home when I'm not acting, that I won't be acting anymore.I just really want to work with Hugh Jackman because he's Wolverine. That would be so awesome."
106,Ronit Roy,"I am a foodie, but I prefer to be at home and enjoy home-cooked food.My wife Neelam is a North Indian, so she will make North Indian food, while my mother will make Bengali food.My family celebrates both the navratras that come twice in a year. We also refrain from eating meat. I just enjoy that people come home, savour the variety of snacks and participate in our puja during this time.I was born in Nagpur and brought up in Ahmedabad, where my father had a small factory.After quitting my job with Sea Rock, I became a Mukta Arts flunky.I decided to do advertising, as ad films were made in only 10 days, and started assisting Sanjeev Sharma and Mansoor Khan. Surprisingly, I was a whiz kid and soon learnt to edit films and became an expert at it.I was editing for Kunal Kapoor when I got my first film 'Jaan Tere Naam' as lead actor."
107,Saif Ali Khan,"A film has to be for commercial success as well as earn you respect as an artist. You don't want to do only things that are designed to run commercially, and neither do you want to do things that get acclaim but don't run.But actors should act. You should see them most often rather than just not.I have a lot of connection to Pataudi. I have spent a lot of time there and I love the place very much, but at no point, do I consider myself a Nawab.I think a lot of a man's outlook in life - at least mine - is shaped by his relationship with his father.Royal titles ceased to be recognised by the Indian government in 1971. The title of Nawab and Maharaja are not recognised by the Indian government anymore."
108,Salman Khan,"In life go straight and turn right.I'm not possessive, I'm caring... Once you realize a person doesn't want that much care, you automatically back off.For me, acting comes straight from the heart. In that sense I don't act at all. I think that to feel the character's pain I have to be myself. Somewhere audiences see that.Why should I marry? One marries to have children, but I already have children! My nieces and nephews are my children.I don't have to show that I am working very hard.There are actors who can pull of a writer's lines; I am not competent enough to do that.If the film is a hit then everyone shares the success. If it is going to be a disaster then it might as well be because of me, not because of somebody else.I don't go out anywhere. I don't go to nightclubs, so meeting somebody in the nightclub is out of question.People are patronizing the theatres with renewed enthusiasm - there is an entire picnic-like attitude when families go out to see movies, which is a very good sign. They want to see larger-than-life characters on the big screen and not just watch movies on television or on DVDs.Any film is about heroism: the triumph of good over evil. If you look back at my films, you will see that as a recurring theme."
109,Sangram Singh,"I would say Karan Patel's vanity van is my favourite hangout spot.I've fought physical disability and was cured because of naturopathy and yoga.Maintaining good health should be the primary focus of everyone.I want to attract as many people to wrestling as I can.Violence has never resolved any issue.Every fight should be settled through love and dialogue.In Haryana, there are two things that are most important in a household. We don't care if we have a big house and several cars or not. But for us, in every household, the sons need to be strong, and the animals need to be in good health.I think each one of us should try and do small things on Diwali so that those who are not as privileged as we are can also have a good festival.First, I only get earthen lamps during Diwali, and I urge everyone to do so, so that people who make these diyas can earn money and have a good Diwali. Also, I celebrate the festival with special children. I take homemade sweets for them like halwa or jaggery and spend some time with them.It's good to be progressive, but don't shun the good things about tradition."
110,Sanjay Dutt,"Parineeta is a classic love story.I have this huge lion tattoo embossed on my arm. I was a little worried as to how we would cover it up. But my makeup man covered the tattoo with makeup. It took close to two hours.As an actor, I am meant to dabble with different themes and genres.I keep the bad-boy image just to make my fans happy.The film is a romance with songs and dances, aimed at a family audience.We're making a commercial Hindi film catering to all types of audiences.A good script and a good brief from the director is enough to let me know what is expected of me.Kolkata is a great city, has great food and great people. We had some problems finding the kind of old buildings we were looking for, and even handling the crowds, but on the whole it was fun shooting there.Kolkata is the relatively unexplored part of India as far as Hindi films are concerned.As a person, I'm pretty much the same except that I've come to terms with who my real friends and supporters are. I don't get particularly friendly with new people at first go."
111,Saqib Saleem,"A brother can give his sister lots of love.I was a bully while growing up.It is a way to express yourself. Fashion has to be individual and I like to express my fashion the way I style myself.Beckham is the best styled person in the world.Not many people know this about me, but my first passion in life was cricket.Thank you Sachin Tendulkar. For teaching me and a million others how to be humble, how to keep fighting and above all how to be consistent in life. In whatever he does he is and always will be the man apart from my father who taught me about life. I love you.When kids my age were crying over girls, my first heartbreak was not because of some silly school time crush but because I lost out on playing for Delhi's Under 14 team, even after I was selected in the playing eleven.One of the defining moments in my life was when I had the privilege to speak to him over the phone. I couldn't say anything - I was tongue tied. I just cried out of sheer happiness. That day I made a promise to myself; One day I will play for Sachin's team- I'll play for team India.I come from a family where two wheelers were not allowed. No seriously not even a tiny cycle around the compound.I can never be on time anywhere."
112,Sayaji Shinde,"Politicians are interesting people and they have good and bad qualities.I have studied many politicians closely.Hindi films do not respect fine actors, it is all about super stars and stardom. Film-making is reduced to revolving around a star's moods.I don't even compel my wife to wear a mangalsutra or a bindi.I am getting good roles in the Telugu film industry. And people are also liking my work. I dub the films myself and this makes a huge difference.The makers of 'Ushakaal' said that if I don't do the film they would shelve the project. I didn't want a good subject to be shelved because of me so I went ahead and did the film.There is a misconception in our society that only women have to follow the norms of wearing a mangalsutra after marriage. Actually there are a few ornaments which even men are expected to wear after marriage.According to me, when a filmmaker is writing a role, a certain actor comes to his mind. Now whether that actor resides in Mumbai or in the Malabar is hardly of any consequence.An actor is an actor is an actor.At a time when there is rise in global temperature and pollution intensifying, it is important to face these issues in through clean and green air by planting indegenious trees. This is a responsibility of each one of us."
113,Senthil,"I never expected my sons to make a career out of cinema. If they are honest and dedicated in their profession, no doubt success would follow them.I'd say that comedy is my God-given gift.I still don't know how I became famous. It all happened so fast.My philosophy was simple: audiences shouldn't say that I just came, stood, and copied another comedy star. They should say 'Senthil acted in this.I had several friends associated with the tinsel world - like A Veerapan, Bhagyaraj, R Sunder Rajan. Thanks to them, I got a few roles in films."
114,Shah Rukh Khan,"I have lived in Mumbai for more than 20 years, have my domicile here, my home and family here.Cinema in India is like brushing your teeth in the morning. You can't escape it.I don't kiss on screen. Period.It is stupid on my part to think of banning the media.Whenever I fail as a father or husband... a toy and a diamond always works.If I talk to a girl, it's assumed that I'm having a scene with her. If I don't, then it's assumed that I'm gay.I don't like the trappings of stardom. I wear the shoes and the Dolce & Gabbana, because I'm told to. But I'm not trapped by it.Some people say, 'Shah Rukh, you work so hard. Why don't you sit back with a glass of red wine or go out on the terrace for a smoke?' But that's not me.There's a personal me, there's an actor me and there's a star me.My life may seem glamorous from the outside but off screen it's as ordinary as anyone else's."
115,Shaheer Sheikh,"I am a person who keeps doing something or the other, pursuing one interest after another.I like challenges, and thus, I keep trying something different and new every time. And these challenges and interests turn into passion.One thing just led to another, and today, here I am, acting in a daily soap, and I am just loving it.I never joined the TV industry for fame.I always wanted to act. I am very passionate about the art. So when I got the opportunity, I was more than happy.I am thankful to all the love that I have received from my fans.It's amazing when people who don't even know you pray for your good heath and success. But being a private person, sometimes I don't know how to handle the adulation that comes my way.I don't mind if what they write about me has some truth in it. Pure imagination makes me feel sad about the whole thing.A lot of subjects are untouched by the Indian Television.Putting yourself in danger just to meet me or talk to me is not a sensible idea."
116,Shahid Kapoor,"While I believe in marriage as an institution, I am also petrified of it.When I don't have a girlfriend, who I am answerable to, I can go out and hang with people. But whether you go for a movie with someone or a meal or a drive, it is assumed that you are dating that person.I had always told my father that before working with him in the same frame as an actor, which I was petrified to do, I wanted to learn from him, so I had pleaded with him for two years before he agreed to write and direct 'Mausam.' It was our dream project and a wonderful opportunity for us to work as a family.I know I have a reputation that is not so flattering, but I guess I owe it to just being a private person. I don't mean anyone harm, and I'm not being mean. I just don't socialise much; I don't party too much. I don't know what to say to the media if I'm not talking about a film that I am doing, so yeah, maybe I am perceived as a snob.I don't have a regular happy family like most people. My parents are separated; my dad married someone else and so did my mom. All my siblings are from my parents' other marriages. So yes, it is complicated, and I don't like talking about it or explaining this to everybody. But all this doesn't stop us from being close to each other.I am a good boy. Sweet. I love to chill. I have a select set of friends, am big on house music, love Goa. I don't read much. Though that is one habit I am trying to inculcate.Films are not mathematics - that's the first thing you need to understand. At least, that's how I feel. They are not words on paper. Films are made with people, with teams and with individual bundles of creativity coming together to fulfill the vision of an individual who is the director of the film.I cannot do a film I don't believe in, however safe it might be.Indian cinema gives you everything that western cinema doesn't. It's maseladar and spicy. If you like Indian food, I think you'll love Indian movies.Personally, having an eight-pack is a high, but professionally, I cannot be obsessed with it. I'm an actor, not a body builder."
117,Shekhar Kapur,"I've never looked at film-making as a career. I've looked on film-making as an adventure. When you come down the mountain, you get ready to climb again.There's a lot of imagination in Asia, and I believe that the next Google will come from there, and the next Pixar. I believe that the great new media companies will come out of Asia and surpass the big media conglomerates that exist right now in the West.I am far more comfortable with failure than I ever will be with success.When I go out to direct a film, every day we prepare too much, we think too much. Knowledge becomes a weight upon wisdom. You know, simple words lost in the quicksand of experience.In this universe, and this existence, where we live with this duality of whether we exist or not and who are we, the stories we tell ourselves are the stories that define the potentialities of our existence. We are the stories we tell ourselves.I often wonder when I make a film - I'm thinking of making a film of the Buddha - and I often wonder: If Buddha had all the elements that are given to a director - if he had music, if he had visuals, if he had a video camera - would we get Buddhism better?When you get up, the night and day is a contradiction. But you get up at 4 A.M. That first blush of blue is where the night and day are trying to find harmony with each other. Harmony is the notes that Mozart didn't give you, but somehow the contradiction of his notes suggest that. All contradictions of his notes suggest the harmony.It was expected of all good middle-class Indian people to build India and, as you know, Indians - when we say, 'build India,' it was all about being an accountant, a lawyer, an engineer. So it was this idea that professionals would build the country.The question is - did Richard Attenborough have a right to make 'Gandhi?' And did Danny Boyle have a right to make 'Slumdog Millionaire?' Quite honestly, if they didn't have the right to make these films, I had no right to make 'Elizabeth.'I think that I altered history in 'Elizabeth,' and I interpreted history far more than Danny Boyle or Richard Attenborough did to 'Slumdog Millionaire' or 'Gandhi.' They took Indian novels or Indian characters and very much stayed within the Indian diaspora."
118,Siddharth Shukla,"I was a child who was interested in sports, and represented my school in football, cricket, badminton and table tennis.My lunch is the staple Indian meal - rotis, vegetables and dal. But instead of wheat rotis, I have rotis made of bran or barley.I have a confession to make - I am very fond of junk food.It's important that we treat our bodies with respect because it's what we have to make do with as long as we live.This entire journey from 'Balika' to 'Jhalak' to 'Humpty' has been a dream.I sleep early and I don't party.I wake up at 5:30 and head to the gym and reach the sets by 8:30. So there is nothing to write about me. But people have to say something, so they make up some gossip. It's okay I guess.As a model, only a limited number of people knew about me.I don't think it makes sense to set high goals about how my ideal woman should be. It is like calling for trouble. That would make one close-minded and not open to meeting different kinds of people.As for me I may not have relatives in the film industry. But I grew up in Mumbai as an avid moviegoer. So I don't feel like an outsider."
119,Sidharth Malhotra,"I just have to attend someone's birthday party or go out for dinner with someone else for us to be in a relationship. That's not going to stop me from socialising, but tell me, which girl would want to be with a guy who goes to bed early and gives more importance to the gym?The idea is to be different with every film, and I'm glad my mother and my brother, who were sitting besides me during the screening of 'Ek Villain,' forget it was me on screen after the first 15 minutes.I think all actors are professional liars.At home, I am a private person, and I like keeping it that way. Maybe that is why I come out as being guarded about my personal life.It is very essential as an actor to be a perfectionist and have a knack for doing different roles over a period of time to keep their fans entertained.I'd rather have a small part in a big film or good story than do a solo film just for the sake of it.Sometimes, I remember, for action continuity or to get all warmed up for an action scene before giving a close-up or saying a dialogue, I would do push-ups. I didn't know any other way to get my body mechanism going.As an actor, when you don't have a reference to pick from, you experiment, try out new things. And what comes of it eggs you on. You realize your capabilities and push your limits.There will be people who don't like you or aren't convinced. I'd rather let my work talk than justify in words.Growing up, I always wanted to play a fighter."
120,Sreenivasan,"Our role as producers is mainly limited to borrowing money from friends when we run short of cash.In films, we tend to come up with something new all the time. Challenges and experiments are new at every stage.We often come across certain directors who mention some of their own flops as their favourites. They will blame the viewers for not realising its merits. I think that is plain hypocrisy.The whole purpose of filmmaking is to entertain the viewers and when it happens, it gives you a high.The viewers have the brains to decide the merits of a film and there is no point in blaming them if it flops.My politics are expressed through the films that I write. That's why doing 'Arabikkadh' was a great experience because I got to associate with like-minded people.As an artist, I am here to get involved in meaningful films. But that does not mean only films like 'Arabikkadha' should be made. If you give an overdose of such films, the subject will become jaded.Varavelpu' has a special place in my heart because it was inspired from my own father's experiences.It is never easy to face the camera, especially for the newcomers.Saroj Kumar is a fictitious character who is free to think anything."
121,Sudeep,"In politics, when you wake up, you can make out who belongs to which party. In cinema, you cannot make out who belongs where. Everybody looks like your friend.I have never really been into working out at the gym, or been the kind who maintained a certain physique.During the making of 'The Villain,' I had put on some weight.I don't believe in stardom; it is like a relationship. Today it is with you, tomorrow it might go to someone else.I like challenges.I make sure I do only audience-friendly films that can be watched with children and the elderly crowd.People connect with my films because they are honest and simple.I don't want easy success. It's boring.I cannot match with anything for the love and affection fans extend.You always carry a character when you come on screen."
122,Suniel Shetty,"Critics matter to me.Shah Rukh is a one-man industry. You have to accept that and salute him.I think 'Main Hoon Na' is like the comeback of a Manmohan Desai film. Farah Khan made you laugh, cry and dance.When the audience comes out of the theatre, they should remember your role and appreciate you for it. They should not forget you.To a Sunil Shetty, J P Dutta was god.I still refuse films offered to me at phenomenal prices and am doing some for peanuts.I have realised I am a director's actor.I play Harsh Vardhan, a good cop. 'Baaz' is a thriller, in which you doubt every character. I loved the script, as it is very tight and exciting.Yeh Tera Ghar Yeh Mera Ghar' is a well made film.A healthy body breeds a healthy mind."
123,Sunny Deol,"Today films are made to cater to commercial markets created by multiplexes, not for those who enjoy good cinema.I was both loved and hated for being upfront. But I was just being myself.I am happy with my family and my colleagues and want to continue making my own kind of cinema. I have never belonged to any camp and have no friends in the industry. Most of them will pay lip service, but when it comes to doing, they tend to shy away.At one time, late Yash-ji, too, wanted to do two to three films, but somehow, I am not the kind to do too many things at the same time. I like to take it slow and steady.While I always thought of making sequels to movies like 'Ghayal,' the filmmakers would almost always veto the idea.I want to do action which is larger than life but has a touch of reality.Without romance, films will be boring. I doubt if people now understand romance, though they may claim it otherwise. I am very romantic in real life.I still don't understand why the tag of 'action hero' follows me. My films have all these elements - romance, action and comedy. None of the fight sequences of my character is an act of randomness. There's a reason to action in my films.Bollywood directors are like cricketers where in one match you score a century, and in the next match, you are out for a duck! Moreover, very few directors are consistent in Bollywood.Usually, family films have characters speaking with each other with much dignity and respect."
124,Suraj Sharma,"I did one or two plays at school. Once I played a tree, so I never thought I would be a good actor.I was a normal kid. I can't explain how normal I was.I like telling stories, I like movies, and I want to work on films. I think I would feel safer behind the camera.Everyone has a conflict inside of them - the conflict between what you should do and what you want to do.When you get to see the world, it changes you. You realise that there are all kinds of people out there.It is really awkward to see myself on screen.You know, tigers are very unpredictable.Before 'Life of Pi,' I wanted to do economics. And now, I realize how bad a mistake that would have been. I just can't see it as my cup of tea anymore.I might survive a few days at sea. Probably not as long as Pi.My ma is an economist. My dad is a software engineer."
125,Suresh Gopi,"I feel that a doctor should have the vision of a leader.Yes, I would love to do more such films that take on issues like corruption.Melvilasam' broke a short, silent phase in my career.Art can influence people, and indeed it should do that as well.When parents accused me of polluting young minds, I was hurt.I have a very clear, genuine vision about what political work should be, what politics and politicians should contribute to the nation.Even I feel I am an ambassador for the Indian police. Even if someone doesn't want to give me that credit, I want to have it for myself.Success keeps you going as a person and as an actor.Be it a cop, or an IAS officer or even a goonda, the audience wants to see me as a person who discusses social issues, asks questions that they have and squeeze out answers from those concerned.For me, acting as Raja Ravi Varma, a legend, is not just exciting but very challenging."
126,Suriya,"My father came to Chennai at the age of 16 from a village in Coimbatore. He was an artist and was clear he wanted to do something, so he came to Chennai and joined an art course for eight years before he came into films.I had this inferiority complex as a child, as I was not good at speaking. I was also not good in studies or sports and would often flunk in four-five subjects.My dad never had a bank balance of more than three lakh and was always extremely compassionate towards his producers.Being in Loyola College exposed me to other options and gave me confidence, apart from the freedom to bunk classes. I became a merchandiser and then a garment manufacturer, and interacting with foreign buyers and manufacturing foreign brands in India gave me a high.I was the eldest child, so I know how it feels to have attention shared with a sibling.How well we understand the kids' world is very important, and I myself am not claiming to be the perfect dad, and from feedbacks from Jo, I understand that more time should be spent with our children.It is very important for both the parents to spend quality time with their children, at least till they are eight years old, whatever be our social status, or even if grandparents are available to take care of them, and that is the message we try to drive home in 'Pasanga 2.'Sixty per cent of how you act is drawn from memories. And it's about who you are. I am a son, brother, husband, father, and caretaker. You connect with certain instances and emotions.I try and imagine myself in situations and figure out how I'd have reacted and responded to them, and then bring that insight into my acting. Much of acting is about borrowing from your real-life experiences.When you act, you want to emote and think in that language. I don't enjoy the process of doing a film in a language I am not good with."
127,Sushant Singh Rajput,"I take time to open up with people. But once I know you, I'm fine. I'm a shy person.For me, the script is important. If it excites me, I'll do the film.My favourite actor is Daniel Day Lewis. He's the finest actor in Hollywood. I've studied his performances.I am ecstatic that 'KPC' was a commercial hit and was critically acclaimed. The 60 days we shot for it were the best days of my life. I still get goosebumps when I think of them.I have seen extreme lows because of factors that were not in my hands - be it not having money to buy my first bike, dropping out of a prestigious engineering college without having a single rupee in my bank account, living with seven boys in a single-room kitchen in Mumbai, or eating nothing but khichdi every day. But I cherish all those moments.Things are difficult for outsiders in the industry, and it is very evident, too. It does not mean that insiders have it easy or that it's impossible for outsiders to break in. More often than not, the difference is about how successes and failures are viewed and magnified.No matter what you achieve, what you want to aspire to be, or how famous and powerful you become, the most important thing is whether you are excited about each and every moment of your life because of your work and people around you.The way Nolan looks at things is just amazing. It can be easily seen in all his films. I was just watching his videos on how he came up with the screenplay of 'Memento,' and it's just extraordinary. It just opens up your mind.I will continue doing things irrespective of the medium as long as I'm excited about it.I experienced a lot of things while I was working with Dibakar Banerjee."
128,Tahir Raj Bhasin,"My father was in the Air Force, so I travelled all over India. I was born in Delhi.My mother worked for Confederation of Indian Industry, and Aptech Computers.I am the only one in my family to get into acting.I am a huge optimist.On the sets of the movie 'Manto,' I found that one of the challenges of embodying real-life stories is the mixed medium of facts and imagination, and how one's collage of experiences colour ones representation on celluloid.Every time a medal is won on the national or international platform, our country really enjoys winners but we don't appreciate the effort that goes into creating winners.It's a big responsibility to play an icon like Sunil Gavaskar.When you are doing a film about real people, you don't have a lot of manoeuvrability when it comes to how much you can add by way of imagination. You have to replicate what they were like. What you can add to it is your version of it.How you carry yourself is how people perceive you.I have been part of really good projects which I'm extremely proud of and 'Chhichhore' will stand tall among my body of work. This is my first Rs 100 crore film and I know I will cherish this moment always."
129,Thalaivasal Vijay,"Both my kids are international swimmers and national champions.Be it 'Thevar Magan' or 'Magalir Mattum,' people still remember me for what I have performed and when it comes to characters, I don't want to restrict myself.Though I do not know much swimming, I am glad that both my children are getting better at it day by day.Puthagam' can be tagged as a complete family entertainer, and the reason I call it the same is because I always wanted to make films that I can watch with my entire family.I've enjoyed my time as an actor, but felt work was becoming repetitive.Having worked as an actor on television for 20 years, I tend to make people act the way I want.Acting is about expressing emotions, which varies from one person to other. If I were to force my co-stars to act the way I want, then I'll be seeing myself in the output, not them.There is only a very thin line which separates a genius from the eccentric.Camphor Cinema is nothing but an extension of family - courteous, kind, joyous and focused. It is like a close-knit family working hard for a celebration.Elephants are very sensitive to smell and they tend to recognise us by our body odour."
130,Tiger Shroff,"If I have to use a body double, it means I'm not well prepared to do what I have to do.Stuntmen don't have a lavish life. They are such hard working people, but not respected enough. And I don't like that. If I become something in my life, I want to give them a better life, take them to a higher level.I look for roles where I can do justice, show people a side of Bollywood they haven't seen before.Action is a universal language, so everyone understands a punch and a kick.Apparently, I used to bite, scratch and growl at people when I was young, so my parents named me 'Tiger.'My becoming an actor wasn't planned. My interest always lied in sports such as football, martial arts, gymnastics and dance.Michael Jackson is so unique, and I look up to him and try to imbibe as much from him and marry it to my own style.I have had a lot of crushes but have never had the courage to go up to a girl and say what I feel. I am scared of rejection.I am comfortable in my character's skin. I am uncomfortable being in my own skin.After my 12th standard, I started preparing for the film industry. I've had no formal acting training."
131,Tovino Thomas,"So, quite often, there are hardly any breaks. But that’s fine with me as, at one point of time, I had stayed home for months without work. I have taken all the rest I needed then.I have no qualms about doing a character who may be below the lead in the pecking order, whether it’s a hero or a villain or a comedian.2019 is proving to be a golden year of Malayalam cinema... As an actor, I have always classified films as either good ones or bad ones... I had five films that released this year in the cinemas and our audiences liked every one of them.All I have tried to do as an actor is push good story telling.I want to be a part of good stories. It’s not about my role, but the overall story that counts.Maayanadhi' was a film I enjoyed working in.For me, Malayalam films remain the most important. I don't want to do more Tamil films just for the sake of it.My fan base is in Malayalam cinema, and that's where I want it to be.I have only two conditions to choose a project - content with substance and space to perform.Movie, being an art form, should have artistic value and should do justice to the artistes."
132,Uday Kiran,"I am proud to say that I was launched in Tamil through 'Poi' by Balachander sir, who was the one who launched the legends like Rajni sir, Kamal sir & Prakash Raj sir.I have worked very hard to shed away my chocolate boy image in order to get a tough look for this action entertainer. I am confident of my success and would love to dedicate the same to Director Balachandar sir.We all have ups and downs in our career, and as an actor going through a rough patch, all I can do is keep working as hard as I can and hope for the best.I have always watched my close friends fall in love, but I never thought it would happen to me.I have met many people, and everyone's impression of me is based on my career.I don't let anything kill my spirit.I know that a lot of people take inspiration from the fact that I was just a common man with no film background who turned into a star.I am not a kind of person now who broods over the failures and negatives.I did my first film when I was in the final year of my graduation. At that time, I was still a kid, and I couldn't read the industry very well.I am not a fitness freak, but I do my regular exercises."
133,Varun Dhawan,"I used to have lot of arguments with my mother due to a lot of bruises on my body for trying my hand at wrestling. I used to say, 'I am Rock,' and I would get slapped.I have this dream of directing. But as a child, I wanted to become a wrestler. Like, in childhood, we used to watch WWF; I was inspired by all of that. One of my favourite wrestlers was Rock, who has become an actor.I wanted to be performer; like, I used to dance at weddings. I felt acting was my calling, and that is something I wanted to do.To do your first film is a dream.I am very happy for anyone who is in love.It's not easy to put a smile on people's faces.I think it's unfair for people to decide what my strength is after just three films.I am a huge fan of shows like 'Breaking Bad,' 'Dexter,' 'The Mentalist.'Anything I do in life, the first person I share it with is my elder brother. He always tells me the way to take it forward.My brother starting earning early in life. I stopped taking money from my parents, and my brother would give me the pocket money."
134,Varun Sharma,"I have always stayed true to my craft.I am not the fittest guy, I don't have biceps and six-pack abs.I am not a conventional hero. I am a regular guy trying to entertain people.I want to be associated with content and characters that will be embedded in the hearts and minds of people for a long time.Traffic snarls or jet life doesn't make a city fast.The character of Chandigarh appears to be slow, but people here are quite competitive.I do not get caught up in mundane, routine things.Basically, life isn't just about eating and partying - we need to figure out unique ways in which we can add to our curiosity levels, besides satisfying the wanderer in us.You can wine and dine all around the globe but the joy of coming back home to a meal cooked by your mom is pure bliss.Cooking is one thing I would love to learn but I keep procrastinating."
135,Varun Tej,"'Fidaa' completely sticks to being a love story. It doesn't have any digressions. Opposites attract, they say.I love to listen to talkative girls. I like 'hyper' types.My father feels that Kammula garu has done magic. At home, he is the best critic. My mother and sister kind of like everything that I do.I came out of the failure of 'Mister' rather fast. It took me just three days.I intend to keep reinventing myself both as a performer and also in terms of my looks for as long as possible.I'd rather be called a good actor than be labelled a good-looking guy. I have been working towards it all along, and I hope to be able to go far ahead, because that's my foremost goal.I can do anything I want with the rest of my body, but the face is something I've inherited. I should thank my parents for it.While love stories at the end of the day, honestly speaking, do not vary a lot in their plots, it is their treatment that separates one from the other.My constant endeavour is to offer something new to the audience. Every movie I pick, including 'Loafer', which offers a strong mother sentiment, tries to give the audiences a sense of watching something different.Right from my first movie, I have tried hard to make sure I am not typecast."
136,Vicky Kaushal,"Whatever understanding I have of filmmaking is because of my stint as an assistant director on 'Gangs of Wasseypur.'Working with Anurag sir was always a dream. He is the person I started my journey with.I did not have any inclination towards cinema. The atmosphere at home was not filmy, and we would never discuss anything related to films.I was an industry kid but was never brought up like one.I think all my films have a different journey. Therefore, I take it as it comes.When I am playing the protagonist of the film, before the release, I feel a certain pressure because I become the face of the film, then, and I have a major responsibility.We tend to say that some films are made for multiplex audience and some for single-screen theatres.I know that in Bollywood, there is this constant talk on which actor's film is minting how much money, but we are living in a time where the focus is shifting from 'actor's responsibility' to the result of a great team work. I believe filmmaking is about that.It is probably the best validation, the best compliment: that when somebody says you are getting good things in life, and you deserve this.When you take this journey of becoming an actor, there are only destinations - one, where people give you that limelight and expect the world from you, and two, they don't know who you are, and they don't care what you are doing. You have to choose where you want to go."
137,Vijay,"I am like a friend to my kids. My wife, Sangeeta, handles their studies, etc.I liked Michael Jackson and used to practice his steps. I enjoy dancing!I wanted to get into films, and my parents were against it. I convinced my mom, and finally she convinced my dad. My dad then felt, who best to launch his son than him? So he launched me, and here I am.I've the highest respect and regards for Shankar sir. He has taken Tamil cinema to a new level. I would have loved to work with him, but there are some date hassles.Controversies are part and parcel of making a big film.I can't stop people from writing imaginative stories about me entering politics.Even today, people tell me that the slapstick humour in 'Friends' is the most viewed comedy track on television. Siddique knows the art of mixing slapstick with genuine humour.My son, Sanjay, and I discuss a lot of things. Like, he gives me feedback on my films and what his friends say at school.As for pressure, there's always the desire to give my best to every film. After all, so many people put in so much of hard work.My closest friends today are, in fact, my friends from college."
138,Vijay Deverakonda,"I think there is no need for anything. There is only a choice of role that an actor has to make. He must live by it.Cricket, politics, and cinema is what a majority in our country are most passionate about. They have the power to divide the best of friends depending on which side you are on.I like Chandrababu Naidu because he is the person who developed the city of Hyderabad and created the software boom. I also like K.T. Rama Rao for his work and the way he helps through Twitter and responds to many causes.Post-'Pellichoopulu,' I received a lot of offers from Tamil industry. I decided I won't do a Tamil film unless I know the language. If I want to do it, I wanted to do it perfectly.Everybody in the two Telugu states, especially the residents of Vijayawada, love both cinema and politics. And 'NOTA' is a cinema with a political subject.I have always fought for respect, I have always fought for survival, so fighting is nothing new to me.Those trying to drag me down through piracy, I want to tell them that I will somehow achieve what I want. I am focused enough to achieve what I want and give the audience what I can.The approach I take in selecting a script is based on what I fancy from the the scripts I'm offered.A learning experience is the best way to sum up my first film credit. It's hard to break into the film industry, and it was a minor role but still my only shot at the movies while I was doing theater.My father came to Hyderabad to become an actor, took an acting course, and realised he was camera conscious."
139,Vijay Sethupathi,"I had no interest in cinema until I was 24 years old. My friends had posters of their favourite stars in their houses, but I was far from a film buff - very detached from films.I came to cinema for money. I had to settle a loan of Rs 10 lakh. I had no other go, so I thought I'd try my luck in films. I was earning Rs 25,000 at that time. It was not even enough for my family.I used to be very photogenic. My brother took a lot of pictures of me in Dubai. I thought maybe I could be a movie star. There was a hurdle, though - I didn't know anything about films.I was always under the impression that acting is an innate gift. One of the first things I heard them say at Koothu-P-Pattarai was that actors should realise the art of acting through their training.Why are numbers so important? I take up a film I like, give it my best, and move on.I believe life is an 'experience ball.' You throw it at someone, it picks up their response... it grows. You play with that ball, learning what it teaches you.Your present is shaped by your yesterday, but you don't have to advertise it.I'm self-taught. Even today, on the sets, I probe the lightmen, the stunt artistes... they are from a period I've not seen; I can visualise it through them.When an actor decides to play a character, he must exude some sort of charisma and look relatable, even if he is playing the role of a really unattractive person.I surrender to my directors. I do that because I respect them immensely. In fact, a director's talent scares me. I admit that they're more intelligent than me, and I submit to that, as an assistant director does. Even when I have suggestions to make, I don't state them strongly."
140,Vikram,"Catching a culprit becomes really easy when there are video footages from the crime scene.I informed Malayalam filmmakers that I can do a film for free if the role excites me.Money is important, but it's not the only driving factor for me.I have an obsession for quality.The trouble is that in south cinema, after you become successful at the box office, market realities dictate your choice of films, and it becomes difficult to experiment.In 'Anniyan,' the character I did had three different looks in the film, and I was able to carry it off.I started the trend of doing only one film at a time.I'm an actor who believes in looking different in every film of mine.I was riding pillion on my friend's motorbike, and we met with an accident which badly injured my right leg. I was bedridden for three years and used crutches for one year before I fully recovered.You will see a different Susi Ganesan in 'Kanthaswamy.'"
141,Vikrant Massey,"I have seen ups and downs. When my chips are down, I remind myself of the time when Aamir Khan spoke to me over the phone and praised my work in 'Dil Dhadakne Do.' What big a validation that is, someone of Aamir Khan's stature to be initiating a call with someone like me. It's a confidence boost!'Lootera' happened nearly 10 years after television. It was the first film I auditioned for.I never thought the media would be interested in me - this is very surreal.From my experience, I can affirm that I don't really know how the women see the world like, but it seems to be quite different from how men do.One thing is for sure: that women are far more compassionate, empathetic, sensitive, and emotional in comparison to men.I would be lying if I would say that I never wanted to be a lead actor. But at the same time, I would say it's a lot of responsibility also; it's too much responsibility.I always believed in curating content, and the only way to do in our country is by turning producer. So then, I thought, lets turn producer and see how it goes.Anything that's good and has a certain amount of quality, slowly but surely, it will be accepted.It feels really grateful, thankful, and happy when your work is appreciated.I think what I look for in a script, it's the relatability quotient that matters the most."
142,Vishnu Vishal,"One thing I have realised is that there are no certainties. Anything can happen anytime.I felt cheated because a lot of people wanted a relationship with my father, and they played me.I won’t say no if I’m approached for a Hindi film.I keep myself away from negativity because it leaves me agitated.I never thought I was an achiever and was always low on confidence.I’m a sportsman. I am used to failures, and bouncing back from them.When I help people around me. It gives me immense happiness.I get angry very fast, and it’s intense. I start breathing heavily, and don’t like it.I have the perfect family, but I would not mind having more dogs around me.My ideal destination is a place where my family is; it could be anywhere in the world and it’ll still be home."
143,Vivek Oberoi,"All I did was make the best of the opportunity that I got in 'Company.'Thanks to the wonderful support system provided by my father, I was never insecure about my future.I'm very secure in my life.I concentrate on acting while my dad handles the business side of my career.Hits and flops will always be there for any actor.'Masti' did so well. It was unexpected and clicked very well with masses.I believe in one principle: Do your work and leave the rest to God.All I can say is I am lucky I have never had any misunderstandings with my co-stars.There is less plastic in Tupperware factory than our film industry. People with plastic smile and plastic heart.If you love someone truly, just look into her eyes. You will find your soul in her."
144,Aditi Rao Hydari,"I don't really understand why we are paid less than the male actors, because we put equal efforts, and recent past has shown that actresses can deliver a hit film. We deserve better pay, equal to what actors get.Though all actors do not make good directors, Dhanush is really one of the finest. He knows exactly how to direct an actor to extract the performance the way he wants it. Perhaps that is happening because he is a performer himself.I must say that Dhanush wears the hat of director and actor pretty seamlessly.I was born to an illustrious family in Hyderabad.My mother is a Chitrapur Saraswat from Mangalore and half-Telugu, and my father is a Bohri Muslim. My mother's father, J Rameshwar Rao, was the Raja of Wanaparthy, a principality of Hyderabad. He was influenced by the socialist movement and became the first Raja to give up his title.My great grandfather from my father's side, Sir Akbar Hydari, was the prime minister of the Nizam of Hyderabad. He was instrumental in setting up the Osmania university. His wife set up the Hydari club for women so that they could play tennis, and she also set up the first girls' school in Hyderabad.My family was extremely progressive. My parents had a love marriage, but they separated when I was two years old. I moved to Delhi with my mom, who got involved with the family business.I'm really pleased with the way my career is shaping up. How many actresses get a chance to work with legends like Mani Ratnam and Sanjay Leela Bhansali?Good cinema has no regional or linguistic boundaries.I consider myself as a director's actor, so I'm open to work with filmmakers from across the country and even abroad."
145,Aishwarya Rai Bachchan,"Even in India the Hindi film industry might be the best known but there are movies made in other regional languages in India, be it Tamil or Bengali. Those experiences too are different from the ones in Bombay.I always believed that my silence on several topics will be an advantage in the long run.I know for a fact that if there's a role which I am suited for, I'll be signed on. I'll never go begging.I was more excited than scared, at the opportunity to work in an English movie.I'm not the type who'll yell about my achievements from the rooftops.Right now, I'm following the Buddhist principle: Smile as abuse is hurled your way and this too shall pass.I have a great story to tell... and I tell it well. No holds barred.I was studying to be an architect, I wasn't plotting to join the movies. Films were just another career option. I took acting up with the same schoolgirl enthusiasm I had for examinations. Acting is a job and I take it very seriously.My family is my strength and my weakness.Sexy in India is not considered positive. But, with today's crop of fresh faces in the modelling arena, being sexy is an asset."
146,Aishwarya Rajesh,"I have definitely not turned glamorous.I want to be choosier. I can't let quality take a back seat... not after 'Kaaka Muttai.'I had a lot of Marwari friends, both in Holy Angels School and Ethiraj College.I am a huge fan of Shah Rukh Khan; I have not missed any of his films since I got hooked to 'Dilwale Dulhania Le Jayenge.'I like multi-tasking.I felt that I should become a film actress first, and then come back to serials and earn good remuneration from it.I used to visit one production house every day, and I used to take up auditions even for small roles. Before my debut, I must have auditioned at almost every single production house.After acting in a critically acclaimed film like 'Kaaka Muttai,' I didn't get any offers for more than a year.My gut told me 'Kanaa' was worth taking up, and it's a dream role for any actor.I am not interested in doing a film on the basis of a good story. I want a proper screenplay."
147,Amala Akkineni,"There's is a fine line between living one's truth and looking good.What I find most deplorable is cruelty of spirit - racism, casteism, and religious or social prejudice.War is such a wasteful activity.Nelson Mandela, Dada Vaswani, Harsh Mander, Shabana Azmi - I admire their humanitarian work. But sadly even Nelson Mandela could not keep corruption out of his cabinet and within a year, I am told, the victims of apartheid turned into perpetrators of corruption on their own people. Greed has no boundaries of colour or country does it?We all go through phases; in one such phase, I was interested to know about the psychic phenomenon.A whole generation is moving away from highly ritualistic practices into a more thinking, spiritual process. By spiritual, I don't refer to a cult or a guru. In your heart, you continue to feel the presence of people who've been dear to you even after they've left.I was extremely close to my mother-in-law and after she, and later my father-in-law passed away, I continue to feel their presence.A story has to have several layers to sustain audience interest in each episode.I do not make resolutions for New Year, but visualise and plan things.Birds and animals in the wild migrate every year to safer and nurturing pastures, leaving behind the old environment. After nurturing their young ones, they return to thrive in the old environs. I use that analogy to meditate. You migrate to your inner soul, nurture the strength, light and creativity there, and return."
148,Amala Paul,"I used to think that only a mother could provide unconditional love and make sacrifices.We actors have a big problem. We have a lot of insecurity and we are fragile. We surround ourselves with people who praise our ego and lie to us... till that moment you realise that these people are not helping you get ahead.I have always been a rebel without a cause.I grow tomatoes, spinach and melons, a pepper vine climbs my coconut tree. I have a home and kitchen of my own.I've turned vegetarian and am on an ayurvedic diet. I go to the beach every day, and I feel the creative energy of Auroville.I want to only be part of films that are worth my time. I give my heart and soul for four-five months and I don't want that to go in vain.I've sold my Mercedes and I'll be getting something electric. I work out of a thatch shed on the roof.I would love to get married, have a baby and adopt one.For the movie 'Bhaskar Oru Rascal' I had to let go of a part of my agreed salary and in fact, had to lend money to the producer when he couldn't meet his financial obligations at the time of the movie's release.Once you are in the character, you should let your inner actor take over you."
149,Amisha Patel,"Had I not made it big, my family would have told me to recheck my decision. Now that I am successful, there is no way. They have to accept it gracefully.I would never deny the importance of the media, but I wouldn't go out of the way to splash my pictures all over town. I'd rather let my work do the talking.I feel French is very close to Urdu. Both languages are beautiful. Sadly, their beauty is lost in translation.I love human beings. I believe that there is so much to learn from every person you meet, including a child.To join or not to join films was the biggest choice I had to make. I'd done two years of biogenetic engineering, was an economics graduate and a gold medalist. I had also been a Bharatanatyam dancer from age five, always won the best actress award in school. Finally, I decided to do things for my soul, chose to act.Being sexy is all about attitude, not body type. It's a state of mind.I work on my body to stay fit, but that does not make me superior to anyone. I am a forthright and hardworking girl.Believe me, it's not easy being an actress and a producer, especially with no big daddy to support you.Life is all about evolution. What looks like a mistake to others has been a milestone in my life. Even if people have betrayed me, even if my heart was broken, even if people misunderstood or judged me, I have learned from these incidents. We are human and we make mistakes, but learning from them is what makes the difference.I reprimand people, even those working with me, for littering the roads."
150,Amrita Singh,"My daughter was never offered 'Student Of The Year 2.'Today's kids have a mind of their own, and they know how to exercise it. Even if I wanted to tell Sara or my son Ibrahim how to lead their lives - which I don't - they would not listen to me. Luckily, Sara chose to complete her studies before pursuing acting. She attended Columbia University and then devoted her attention to Bollywood.I do not know how anyone can mould anyone.Like everybody, I too believed that couples lived happily ever after. But it only happens in books.The best thing about my marriage are my two kids.If my children want to pursue their dreams, I will always support them.I have a bad memory - thank God for that!My kids and I live like three fun-loving hermits. We're quite bohemian.I'd just love to ride off into the sunset with my love. I've only seen the sunset so far. Maybe I can earn my own Ferrari so I can ride off in the sunset without anyone by my side.I need to work to support myself and my kids. No one pays for my support."
151,Amruta Khanvilkar,"There are some women who have made some really hurting remarks about my relationship with my husband Himanshu Malhotra. They even dared to ask me if I have divorced him just because I don't put my pictures with him too often. Now that is really ridiculous!Himanshu and I have known each other for over 13 years, and I don't have to prove anything to anyone. Why should I go gushy over my husband on social media when I would rather keep my love and feelings private?Himanshu and I travel together whenever possible, but there are times when I like to travel with my mother and maasi. It is really shocking that trolls comment on that, too. They say 'Don't you get along with your mother-in-law that you don't take her along?' Now, who would accept such remarks about one's mother?I love kids a lot. I love to spend time with them. They give me the energy to live, and I would love to bring a smile on their faces.Marriage has changed Himmanshoo in some ways. Throughout our 10 years of courtship, he was more liberal. But after marriage, he has become a typical Indian husband.I love Meghna Gulzar's film making and her style of story telling. In her films, every character, small or big, is beautifully etched.When 'Pune-52' was offered to me, I liked the script, but I wasn't convinced about the kissing and other intimate scenes. I tried talking to the director, but things didn't work out.I don't know where things are going wrong. I refused 22 offers for lavani numbers and five films. I was not happy with the kind of offers coming my way. Even for the lavani number 'Vajale Ki Bara' in 'Natarang,' I was the last option. I was finalised one day before the shoot was to begin.I don't know why I am not offered woman-oriented films. Films like 'Satrangee Re' went house-full at some centres, but I didn't have much to do in the film. Everyone came up to me and said that I looked pretty but nothing beyond that.Things work very differently in Bollywood. There is a lot of camping there."
152,Amyra Dastur,"When dancing for mass numbers, you can throw your hands and legs anywhere, but contemporary dance is a whole different ball game. Every move has to be pointed, graceful and must look elegant. It's not easy trust me, but is a lot of fun nevertheless.I really love Vidya Balan and Priyanka Chopra and want to do films like them.I want to do one or two commercial films, but also want to do off-beat movies.I want to be taken seriously as an actress.The first time I visited Jaipur was during a school trip, when I was 14 years old.I am obsessed with silver jewellery, so I visited the Johri Bazar, which is famous for it and bought a lot of silver rings, earrings and pendants.When you are in a different city, you must relish the local food and I always like to try the authentic taste and flavours of a city.I really respect Telugu cinema and the fact that people out here have a totally different style of working and are at par with Bollywood. Sometimes, they beat Bollywood with the kind of films they make.I'm a big fan of RGV and I adore Amala Akkineni.Raju Gadu' is a situational comedy where I play a fun and bubbly character. She's a proper Andhra girl who's modern but loves donning desi looks."
153,Andrea Jeremiah,"I am a huge romantic.I have never thought of myself as an actor.I was almost on the verge of studying medicine. But then, I realised I would have to give up singing. That is when it dawned on me that I could have a career in music.I am not a method actor. I would call myself a spontaneous actor.For an actor with his experience, Kamal Haasan's never shown a complacent 'Been there; done it' attitude.I'm the type who minds my own business and am not keen on giving interviews on my mom's birthday, or my dog's birthday.I firmly believe marriage should happen as a by-product of love.For sure, I won't go hunting for a guy to love and get married to. But once I'm in love, I'll do what it takes to make it work.I work with big directors. I work with good actors. I act in female-centric films. And I do all this without ever indulging in a casting couch experience. Because I believe in hard work, talent, and blessing.Casting couch is not just a man's fault. It is important to say this because we blame the other side always."
154,Anita Hassanandani Reddy,"These 24-hour gyms are a blessing and super convenient. For actors doing daily TV shows, we have to stay in shape.Working out, no matter what time of the night, rejuvenates me. At times, I don't feel sleepy after a workout session, as I am all fresh and charged up, and I don't mind compromising on my sleep.I think that, generally, a woman brings in luck for her husband after marriage, but in my case, my husband is lucky for me.My work is appreciated; I am getting good offers. Honestly, we are both doing well professionally. My husband has also been busy with work, and so have I.Honestly, I have a decent sense of humour with people I am close to.If I am comfortable, I say what I want to. But yes, while doing a comedy show, I am slightly reserved as a person. Since it's scripted, it's not a problem. I can manage.Comedy is the toughest. If it goes little bit here and there, and your partner doesn't cover up for you, then everything can go wrong.My character Preet in 'Fanaah' had a very distinctive appearance: loud make-up and dramatic clothes.We are often told by our friends and family members to not go to a particular place owing to some unkown energies that might have existed there, making us form superstitions in our mind.My role in 'Hero' is not a lengthy one but a powerful one. It was a nice opportunity, and I grabbed it."
155,Anupriya Goenka,"I initially moved to Bombay to work in the corporate space. After settling my family here in due course of time, I turned to acting which initially started off as a hobby that I wanted to pursue on the side and then became my profession to sustain my passion around five years back.That is what I seek, to essay interesting and challenging characters, which develop me as an actor and at a personal level to work with people who inspire me to push my boundaries and work on interesting scripts which which turn into refined work of art and leave a mark on me and the audience.I want to work in different genres with varied teams across different industries and to get as much of an enriching experience as I can. That is my wish.People do recognize me sometimes. I occasionally get stopped and they have lovely things to say which is very overwhelming.I truly enjoy and love acting, it's a passion and is therapeutic for me. It is the one thing that makes me truly happy. My sole goal is to grow as a performer each day.The most important factors for any artist, is the honesty towards one's craft, hard work and passion that guides them.It's a conscious decision to keep trying to do something new, to do things that excite me from my gut.I like to take on roles that help me explore a different side of me, collaborate with people who I've always admired or newer people who have something interesting to say.I was auditioned for 'Sultan' for the lead role in 2015. My auditions were very detailed as it was for the female lead. They took around 10-11 auditions for it in the span of 2 weeks. It was very hectic and tiring for me.In fact, Salman Khan is a kind of an actor who doesn't take anyone's limelight while shooting. He is a very secure actor. He has some kind of aura around him. He is least bothered as to which actor is getting how much screen space."
156,Anushka Sharma,"Tell me one director who will go on record to say that I don't get along with them? I get along famously with all my directors because I am what I am today because of them.We all know that a beautiful face is an important aspect of an actor's personality if he or she wants to make it big in Bollywood.I am not as confident as the characters I play. I am a bit aloof. I am uncomfortable in social situations.I do not consider myself a feminist. I do not believe that by doing female-oriented films that depict a woman fighting the system, we can change the system.I think compassion is important but love fizzles out eventually. But if there is compassion in a relationship, things can always be worked out.Sometimes I get extremely disturbed with the things that are written. But you can't do anything about it. As a celebrity, you are putting yourself out there to be judged, and that's fine. I am now learning not to get affected by such things. I am building my career and making choices that I think are right while minding my own business.I take pride in saying that I am an army officer's daughter even more than being an actor.Once, I was coming back from school, and there was this guy who was eve-teasing me and my friend. I had a Milton water bottle that I flung it at his face. My dad told me if you are in a crowded place and a guy eve-teases, you should make noise. I did exactly that and got people on the road to beat up the guy.When I meet someone from the army background, there is an instant connection. We live in the best five-star hotels of the world, but outside my home I will be equally comfortable in any army cantonment or army guest house. Telling my friends that my father was in the army was like telling them that he is the second-richest man in the world.I have never been a girlie girl and have always been a boys' girl with an equal amount of friends who were boys and girls."
157,Anushka Shetty,"When I used to teach yoga in Bangalore and Mumbai, I noticed many clients struggling to cope with their weight. During some days, they would come in with plans to work out harder than usual because of events they'd have to attend later that week. The insecurity of appearance is something everyone goes through... even I.Factors such as timing, luck, and destiny have a bearing on success. But success and failure are good teachers. Failure means something better is waiting for you. But I will allow myself to get upset at failure only if I know I have not given it my all.Once the makeup is on, it is easy to enter the character's frame of mind.I'm still surprised when people tell me I look like a queen.When it comes to guys, my dad is the measure of the perfect man. And that's a pretty tough standard to match up to.It's very important to be conscious and happy from within. No beauty cream can come close to the wonders a balanced body-mind can do for you.I like men with honest, frank eyes. And that's the reason I cannot talk anyone who has their sunglasses on.Yoga has always been a part of my life, and it has had a major effect on me as a person, inside-out.I can put all the idols on my bed and sleep, I'm so fond of them.I have no problems with failures, I'm afraid of failing within myself. At times when I know I did something wrong, I don't sleep that night. I'm scared of facing myself."
158,Asha Parekh,"My mother was very keen I learn dance and I learnt so many forms.I did 6-7 films as a child. But it was taking a toll on my studies. So I went back to being a full-time student at JB Petit here in Mumbai.In fact, I never gave up doing dance shows despite films and even started my own dance school.I feel blessed and lucky that some of the film industry's most magical and iconic songs where legendary composers and singers have collaborated have been filmed on me.I know I admitted to being in love with Nasir Hussain in 'The Hit Girl', but as much as I loved him, I could never consider breaking up his family and traumatising his children. It was far simpler and satisfying to be on my own.I met my share of boys but the end result was always the same - they weren't the right kind of men for me.Over time, my mother also gave up her dream of seeing me as a bride because whomever she showed my horoscope to would say my marriage wouldn't be a successful one. It was not the kind of thing I believed in, but it did grant me some semblance of peace.Marriage is not all rainbows and butterflies; you have to give in to your partner's whims every now and then, and that's a two-way street.But since I did my first film with Shammi Kapoor ji, he is my favourite. I was very shy to face the camera. In my first few shots with Shammi chacha, I was very nervous. He was very patient with me and guided me in every shot.I was a dancer, so it was easy for me to dance in films. I had studied Kathak, Bharatnatyam, Kuchipudi, Odisi and Kathakali much before I even thought of becoming an actor."
159,Asin,"Most actors don't like doing still photo shoots, but I love them. I'm very comfortable, and I enjoy the clothes, looking good, and freezing the moment.Apart from English, I speak my mother tongue Malayalam, as well as Tamil, Telugu, and a bit of Kannada and French.I know Hindi.I've dubbed for all my films, including 'Ghajini.'My film career was never planned.I will definitely be doing films down south if anything good comes along.I would like to do all kinds of films.Now that I am a part of the Hindi film industry, I hope I can do different roles with a lot of scope.It was coincidental that 'Housefull 2' and 'Bol Bachchan' came back-to-back. It's not that I have a special affinity for them and so I chose them; they just came my way.I am flexible and comfortable enough to pull off any genre."
160,Bhumi Pednekar,"I love wearing heels.I stand for body confidence and against fat shaming, but I will not support people who live on bad cholesterol.I take two hours to get ready. I believe in the power of make-up.Just because I am an opinionated and strong girl doesn't mean that I don't believe in vanity.I have always had a flair for acting; maybe that's why I enjoyed casting so much.I just want to work with talented people and learn from them.I'm a very big Shah Rukh Khan and Salman Khan fan. I've grown up seeing them, and they're larger-than-life in the true sense for me.I've always been an overweight girl, and I've never had an issue with that. I'm very comfortable with my body.I have a strong personality - I know who I'm outside my work, and I'm nothing like the characters I portray.I have realised what my pitch is, and I'm in this industry for the pure reason that I love acting."
161,Bipasha Basu,"I don't think I've done any profound work yet... People ask me, 'How would you want to be remembered?' I tell them I don't want to be remembered! I'm not here to become a Madhubala or receive a Lifetime Achievement Award. I'm not that kind of a person. And I'm not brash about it; it's just the way I am.I keep my distance from politics. Lots of money has been offered to me for campaigning over the years, and I have always refused. I used to be very politically aware and very opinionated, but I don't want to involve myself.When things have gone really wrong in my life, I've cried like a child. I have really, really cried. I cry it out. Two-three days I cry, and then I'm like, enough, time to deal with reality and figure a way out. This is the way I have dealt with everything.You're born single, you die single, but why not being in a relationship is some special 'single' status, I don't understand. Life is less stress being single, I have to admit.It was Vikram Bhatt and 'Raaz' that got me interested in the medium of cinema. Before that, I was like any other youngster dabbling with various things - modelling, films - without a definite direction or focus. Now that I'm working with all of them, life has come full circle for me.I believe everything negative that happens in your life is for a positive reason. If your heart breaks, you know that you are a human being and it happens. But you can't mope over it. There's only one life. You better get on ahead and fast. Fast enough not to let your past ever catch up with you.I am a positive person. I am not cynical. If you are born in this world, no matter who you are, negative things will happen. If you aren't positive as a person, you'll be very unhappy. It's extremely important to be positive, to laugh, to be happy, to accept life as it comes.I have blind trust in people. Even if that ends up hurting me, I won't change. I will go on trusting people because that's the only way I know to love someone.I can't let the baggage of my private life get into work. Artists are more fragile than normal people. But I know that I am a role model for zillions of people, so no matter how deep you are hurting, you need to come out strong.Nothing can save something that is not meant to be, no matter how hard you try."
162,Deepika Padukone,"I am not very comfortable about dancing at weddings and New Year parties. Maybe it's because of the way I have been brought up; I wouldn't want my family to feel that cringe moment. Dance is an art for me.I feel ups and downs are a part of one's career, and this totally depends on how you take it. You can either be knocked down by the negative things, or you can take it in a positive way and learn from it.Maybe because I am from a sports background, I don't give up easily. I am a fighter.My character in 'Cocktail' was different from my personality. Homi Adajania took me to London, showed me how girls dress and behave there. I had not seen that kind of lifestyle before.Preparation is definitely important, but it depends on the kinds of roles I do. Like, I completely identify with my character in 'Yeh Jawaani Hai Deewani.' I had to be myself and I didn't have to actually prepare for it.Comedy is the most difficult. Comic timing is something which you either have it in you, or you don't. You have to have a good sense of humour to be able to understand it. A split second can make you lose the punch.I have always believed that chemistry can't be created between two people. You either have it or you don't. The script can only enhance it.For me, competition is good; that is what keeps me on my toes and keeps me going. I am always trying to better my own work, do better than my earlier films... do films that are challenging and exciting for me.At some level, I feel it is nice to know that a film of yours is doing well at the box office and has also got great reviews. That feels like success.The best feeling is when you are remembered for the character you play on the screen and people associate you with that character. There is no better feeling than that feeling."
163,Dimple Kapadia,"I was never a 'Mills and Boon' kind of a person.I was never a chiffon and satin person. I am always a cotton person. It's just the way I am.I get attracted to different things. I have a different take on everything. I like to do different things. I don't like the regular stuff.My journey with Rajesh Khanna was good, thrilling... a roller coaster ride. I feel honoured to have two children with him.Women sometimes get so caught up in life... their marriage takes over their life, their relatives take over their life, and then they forget who they are.The challenge itself is to exceed certain high standards you've set for yourself.I got more than my share in life; a little more wouldn't hurt.I'm a very open person, and I am not ashamed of it being out there. It's part of life.As a viewer, I decide when I see the promo of a film whether I want to watch it or not. No amount of marketing can convince me otherwise.Actors used to concentrate on acting, but today they are businessmen, too, and think about the numbers game as well. They multi-task very well. It's admirable that they have this ability."
164,Disha Patani,"I was so shy, I didn't have friends 'til 16 or something.I could never imagine myself acting in front of a camera or doing anything in front of the camera. I was a very shy girl.I got the opportunity, and I grabbed it, and slowly, I started finding a lot of interest in acting.I think I am very anti-social.I think I am lucky enough to be getting this chance also that people want to know about me. I don't want to complain over it.I don't have newspapers in my house. I have a news application which only gives me important news, no Bollywood. So even if there is some report about me, I don't know.I am fine because somebody's opinion can't become my reality.I grew up with a sister and a younger brother in a house where every evening was spent performing a dance routine in front of our parents with my sister.My father made me very tough.My house was a place where there was no difference between being a boy or a girl."
165,Divyanka Tripathi,"I need to find the right guy and the right family. The day I find something worth my while, I will get married and have kids, too.I usually have a 13-hour workday. But at times, we get lucky when we wind up in 8 or 10 hours.I really believe that some things happen for a reason, and they make you a better person.I am still a hard-core romantic.Even though I am an actor, by nature I am what you could call a homely girl.After certain ups and downs, a person does change, and I have changed for good.I have started exploring my own life and have started valuing myself. I have started valuing my individuality.We must never lose our individuality.If you are good to people, they reciprocate with good behaviour.No actor can be a complete artist without trying his/her hand at comic roles."
166,Erica Fernandes,"My hair is quite silky and straight; however, every time I wash my hair in Hyderabad, it almost turns into a broom. The water is quite hard, and I didn't realise what the problem was until I saw another friend of mine facing a similar issue.I am very excited, as 'Kuch Rang Pyar Ke Aise Bhi' is my first show on television, and I am thrilled about this new adventure in my career. It is an honour to be associated with such a fantastic team.As a child, I have always wanted to have my fingers in many pies, and working on television was always on my checklist.Being in the public eye puts you in a fix, and people are always wanting to know what you are up to.I guess stars do not want to share anything about their personal life because then there is a question of where is the relationship going and so on and so forth.My mother takes care of my health. She makes sure that the food cooked is in olive oil. She takes charge of our health also because my dad is a heart patient. So on sets, I do take care of myself. But at home, it's my mother who is the boss of our health!I am never up for rain sequences because nothing can beat the excitement and thrill of natural rain.One cannot take natural resources for granted just to entertain viewers.After having acted in films down south, I always wanted to work on the small screen but couldn't say yes to everything that was being offered to me.The whole saas-bahu drama is very cliched. I feel there's already too much of that on TV. So I was waiting for something like 'Kuch Rang Pyar Ke Aise Bhi.' The show offered a fresh and interesting plot."
167,Esha Gupta,"My day starts at 5 A.M. and gets over at 10:30 P.M. Its a long day but I love it... I can't sit idle.Of all the options I had got, I think whatever films I have chosen to do are best.I am not saying that I won't do big commercial films.I still don't know what genre I fit into. I want to try my hand at different things and find out what I am best at. I want to discover myself as an actress.My parents are extremely proud of me.Being a vegetarian really saves lives.If you love animals, please don't eat them.I love watching horror films because I don't get scared easily.I clean my own utensils, my house and I even travel alone. I don't know what the life of a superstar is like.I don't think women in India are vulnerable."
168,Fatima Sana Shaikh,"I had given up on acting because I would go for auditions every day, but nothing would happen.I tried my hand at photography and worked with a studio for six months.I thought of learning cinematography, so I assisted a cinematographer for an ad.Shah Rukh Khan is the love of my life. I love Aamir Khan also.When such acting powerhouses take note of your work and express their appreciation, it is an overwhelming feeling. I could not believe it when Rishi ji tweeted. Then Amitji and Rekha ma'am sent handwritten letters, which I have read more than fifty times. 'Dangal' is a very special film for me, and these are my lifetime treasure.I was very young during 'Chachi 420' and don't remember much now.Kids and adults are treated differently on sets. Being a kid, you can get away with anything, and it looks cute. But as an adult, it's a whole new journey.At one point, I had lost my confidence as an actor, and working again was tough. I started stammering due to lack of confidence. It took time, but things became better.I faced many ups and downs, like any other actor: not getting through auditions or even worse - getting shortlisted and not being selected. Most actors go through the process.I was not getting work, even after auditioning for films. So I started working in a studio as a photographer; I assisted a cinematographer for two ads. I was thinking that I will get into photography or cinematography or assist someone. But then the 'Dangal' offer came, and I was busy with the auditions."
169,Freida Pinto,"I keep saying I'm not at all famous in my own country, because people do not think I have done anything for India.I did not particularly enjoy modeling. I felt I was only utilizing 10 or 20 percent of my abilities. In India, it's just another job.I always imagined that I would learn something each time that I would take to a new project, then I realized that each new project poses a completely different challenge.I guess confidence is the only thing that I take from project to project, but I'm always open to learning everybody's style - the director, the actor I'm working with.I tell you why I like Chanel so much: when I started off, no one wanted to give me clothes to wear. Absolutely no one! All the labels said, 'Who is she?' But Chanel believed in me from the very beginning.I think even the most beautiful person looks stupid on Skype.I've learned to develop a thick skin, but you're bound to be affected when you read something bad about yourself in the paper and it's rubbed in your face over and over.When a doctor is performing an operation, his mind cannot be somewhere else. And it's the same with actors. You have to commit yourself mind, body and soul to a project in order to do justice to it.I'm glad I'm a strong person.As the world's getting filled with temptations, we're getting a bit frivolous and a bit fickle."
170,Genelia D'Souza,"I don't see a difference between the big screen and the small one. We are entertainers, and the medium doesn't matter.Every role I do is a dream role for me because I can't imagine I'm doing it.I eat egg whites a lot. Aside from that, I eat everything. I try to avoid too much oily food, but I do eat carbs. I have to have a balanced diet.I'm an athlete, so I can get up one day and run and it wouldn't bother me. I don't get the time because I work for long hours every day. Being constantly on the move itself helps me stay fit. I don't go to a gym. I use the stairs, not the lift. I'm not into fitness, but I feel I should start, as it's healthy.No doubt, my role in 'Urumi' has been one of my best so far. It surprised me as an actor and made me more confident.Following 'Urumi,' I did get a lot of offers from Malayalam, but frankly, managing films in several industries can become a little hectic. So I decided not to take them up.I'm a fast and impatient dresser, so I can't dress myself up for too long. I don't even need a lot of makeup, so I'm usually ready in about half an hour.At home, a T-shirt and something loose like harem pants would do. If I'm stepping out, a pair of blue jeans and a white tee are just fine.Considering the regular use of make-up and the fact that I'm under the glare of the harsh shooting lights practically all the time, I'm adamant about using really strong cleansing milk to get the make-up off my skin, and I never sleep with make-up on, however tired I am.When it comes to make-up, I usually go au natural most of the time and opt for a basic blush, lip gloss and kohl for a day look."
171,Hansika Motwani,"Fame gives you a high.Asked to choose between money and fame, I'd choose the latter every time.I watch my films with my mum and other family members, you know. I also know there are thousands of women who watch my films. I don't want to set wrong examples.As a 17-year-old, I remember positively dreading dance sequences. I would come to shoots, quaking with nervousness at the idea of making other artistes do retakes due to my mistakes.Whenever I am asked about my personal relationships, I politely reply, 'No comments.'The Tamil industry, while being better than all the other film industries when it comes to treating female actors, is still dominated by men. So, I can only work within the space offered to heroines, and I think I am doing that.I had worked in Hindi films like 'Jaago,' 'Abra Ka Dabra,' 'Koi Mil Gaya,' but 'Desamuduru' was a different experience.I hate interference, and I don't interfere in others' lives.My mum is my biggest critic. She said I was good for the first film, but I can still be better, and I need to polish my acting skills.I need to thank my director, producers, and artists as well crew members of all my projects."
172,Hema Malini,"I have great admiration for Atal Bihari Vajapyee.I am joining BJP, as I feel very close to its ideology.Darian is a Greek name, and my grandson is definitely going to be a Greek God, just like his grandfather.I was never the kind to throw parties for my birthday. I remember how embarrassed I used to be when they'd make me cut a cake on the sets, and the unit would sing 'Happy Birthday.'When my mother was around, she would insist on celebrating my birthdays.I just want my daughters and their families to be happy.I started my career with her. I was supposed to do my first film in Tamil in which she was the other heroine. The film was titled 'Vennira Aadai.' It was a love triangle, with Jayalalithaaji and I playing the hero's two love interests. But the director Sridhar removed me from the film after a few days' shooting.Jayalalithaaji was not just a politician: she was the messiah of the masses.They tried to humiliate and cow her down in every way possible, but Jayalalithaaji was unstoppable. With every attack, she became stronger.The few days that I shot with Jayalalithaaji, I got to observe her very closely. I was very impressed by her grace, beauty, and dignity. She came to the sets with her mother. So did I. She remained aloof on the sets and didn't speak much to anyone."
173,Hina Khan,"Living in the 'Bigg Boss' house is a roller-coaster ride. I didn't expect to reach the finals. But I was sure that I would be in the top five.I am imperfect and proud of it. No one is perfect.I am a huge 'Bigg Boss' fan, and I have watched every season.I am a big fan of Sakshi Tanwar. I love her as a performer.I was bitten by a viper; there were two marks on my hand.There is a certain line that I draw for myself, when it comes to what to post and what not to on social media.It's not that I am not comfortable wearing a bikini on screen. If I get an opportunity in future, why not?I am good with heights, but my biggest fear was creepy crawlies.'Bigg Boss' is my favourite show.Even in 'Khatron,' I used to wash my own clothes."
174,Huma Qureshi,"Honestly, I got a lot of offers which were similar to 'Badlapur,' and I didn't want that. Unfortunately, we live in a world which is so myopic that they only want to offer you what you have already done.When I am doing a role, I don't think that I am getting to wear a mini skirt or show my stomach. I am doing a role because I am an actor.If you think that one should do a commercial picture because everyone is doing it and that one will become a big star after that, I think that if you don't have that grain in you, it will not happen.'Gangs Of Wasseypur' had two parts and 200 actors. I didn't think it would be that successful and go to international festivals. These things just happen. You should just do films that you like doing.I started getting a lot of work once I came to Mumbai. I was working with some of the biggest ad filmmakers. But I had to give auditions.I just love watching 'Andaz Apna Apna.' Every single time, I end up laughing so much that my jaws start hurting.It's not at all easy to make people laugh. Kudos to those who can do it so well.As an actor, I would love to do an out and out comedy.Anybody who says that favoritism doesn't exist in Bollywood would be lying.My father runs a restaurant business in Delhi, so if I had chosen to sell kebabs, it would be far easier for me than for anybody else."
175,Ileana D'Cruz,"When I have actors flirting with me in acting, in my head, I am thinking, 'If I flirt back, I could definitely land a film with this guy. If I consider going to his house for drinks, considering he has invited me, I could definitely get a film with him.' But I just don't want to do that.Eleven years of acting it has been for me, and I still sometimes think I am not cut out for this. I hate the people-pleasing that goes with it, and the stupid politics, but that is with every kind of work and job.There are some actors that I know I won't do a film with no matter how good the film is.When people ask me to describe my journey in Hindi cinema post-'Barfi!' I actually don't know what to say.I am being selfish here by saying this, but I believe 'Barfi!' helped me the most. It got me recognition and respect.The reason I did 'PPNH' was because I wanted to do something different, wacky, and mainstream after 'Barfi!'My personal life is only my business and the business of the people who are close to me.If you are visible in the whole film, but there is no depth in your role, then the role is not significant.Acting is a career where you keep learning with every film you do.I don't think I will ever understand Bollywood. And I'm happy about that because it is a big, crazy, world. It's too complicated and chaotic to understand."
176,Janhvi Kapoor,"In acting, you have to fool yourself - you mess with yourself into believing things.You cannot sit at home at act. You need a story, a director, you need people to believe in you, to put you through that journey. It is not something you can attain within yourself.I don't smile all the time. Trust me, there have been days when I have been a mess.I think of what that person must be going through and thinking, that they might feel better by pulling someone else down. No one would say this to your face, but social media makes us all faceless, and you don't get called out for this.It takes a certain amount of courage to not be pessimistic. I'd like to believe there is good in everyone.My attendance in school was 30 per cent. I was always travelling with my parents.After I finished school I wanted to do a bunch of courses - art history in Florence, fashion in London and acting in Los Angeles. So I started with acting, and soon I knew this is it, this is what I need to do.I'm so proud of my parents. I need to make them as proud of me.My mom and dad used to call me 'full drama'. Mom had many videos of me as a kid where I was doing some dance moves, and suddenly the next moment, I was on the floor.People shouldn't think that something is their birthright. They need to prove themselves."
177,Jennifer Winget,"I don't watch daily soap. I've never seen my shows as well except for the scenes in which I really want to improve something or correct something.I like watching comedy shows. I only watch comedy or action.Though both films and television sell emotions, let's not deny that it's way more challenging for small-screen actors to earn their respect.I want to marry a good person, not his profession. If the person is good, the profession doesn't matter. I hold honesty, simplicity, and genuineness above everything.If somebody is good to me, I'll reciprocate. What's the harm? If somebody says 'Hello' to me, I won't turn my back on him.I like to give myself time to deal with an issue. I get to the root of the matter and learn from it. I don't like to repeat mistakes.Responsibility for me is to be myself - which is not perfect.No one is perfect. We all have issues.I love social media. It's nice to share a side of me that people don't generally get to see or know about. I want them to know me, beyond my characters.While we teach our daughters about self defense, we should teach the sons about being respectful as well. A society cannot function properly if only one gender is rising. It has to be in tandem. It cannot be unequal. There has to be balance for upliftment."
178,Juhi Chawla,"I try to use the landline whenever I can. We cannot do without the mobile phones, but we don't need to use them indiscriminately. We are overusing it; we are misusing it.The mobile phone is not a toy; it's a device that uses radio waves.Why do we wait for tragedy to strike to tell someone how special they are, or how special they were?When I look back at my career and my life and how much I have learnt, I feel blessed with what I have. I have stopped fighting with myself.There is an amazing power getting to know your inner self and learning how to use it and not fight with the world. If you know what makes you happy, your personality, interests and capabilities, just use them, and everything else flows beautifully.Our films tremendously influence people. But at the same time, no one goes to the cinema to listen to lectures, so if you have an interesting story, and if you can showcase it as a film, and its messages are good, then it's like an icing on the cake: it shall be a superhit. And if I get those kind of films, I'll definitely want to work on it.At the end of the day, we always show that truth triumphs. We don't leave the movie in the middle saying, 'Great, pick whatever you want to and go out there and do something wrong'. Bollywood is not the only influence in a person's life. They are also affected by their family and friends.I am my favourite villain!I only know acting. But had I learnt singing earlier, I would have become a singer.I would love to have a nice straight nose, which God never gave me!"
179,Jyoti Amge,"When people see me on TV, they become very happy because they don't have to interact with me. When they start interacting with me, they ask me questions like I'm a baby or treat me like I'm a baby and hold me like I'm a baby, and that's what they do wrong, really.People like me might be small in stature, but they can also act.I am proud of being small.I would like to be an actress in Hollywood and win an Oscar. The only difference is my height.Everybody loves me so much, they just want to carry me around. Sometimes I think to myself, 'When am I going to stand, because I'm being carried all day?'I don't let everyone pick me up. I only let myself be picked up by whomever I want to be picked up by.I don't like it if I am being held like a baby. If someone holds me normally, and I'm not being coddled, I feel much more comfortable.Regular people should not underestimate people who are small. In every aspect, they can do the things that normal people can.It's hard for me to reach things. It's good I have brothers and sisters to help.The worst part about being so small is that I always have to rely on someone. I can't go anywhere on my own, so I'm always dependent. I can't run or walk too fast. If I was taller for a day, I'd just go off on my own independently."
180,Kajal Aggarwal,"Trust me: I've been travelling, making movies, and spending the remainder of my time at home.I recently read an article on how I was dropped from a film because I couldn't dance! It was so ridiculous that I decided to shut up about it. Let people say what they want to. It's such a waste of time.Akshay Kumar is a senior in the industry, and I consider myself lucky to be working with him. Each film of his opens to a packed house. Today, a film will sell only if you have a story. The audience is smart and won't be taken for a ride. And I'm confident about my movies.I'm happy that all my films are different from one another.You can't do anything to a film post its release. I concentrate on working hard, giving the required inputs for the roles, having discussions with my directors and co-stars. It isn't possible to predict the fate of any film. I don't take failures to heart and successes to my head. These are part and parcel of this career.I think I'm a story-based artiste. So I would opt for the performance-oriented role. I usually go by intuition while choosing a script. Also, I do not analyse my performance, nor do I bother about how my film has been performing at the box office. I personally love challenges and am game for taking up things which I haven't attempted before.I don't consider myself a competition to anyone. There is ample space for everyone here. When there are directors who create characters for me, why should I feel bothered or insecure? When it comes to updating myself, I work very hard to relate to the emotions of characters I play.I've admired Lawrence master from his choreographer days. I love how he experiments and makes it work. I like his attention to detail and the intrigue in his movies.Certain scripts require an ensemble cast. I'm absolutely fine with that. I will not deprive myself of the chance to be part of a good film because of insecurities or fear of losing my market. But my role must be well-defined.I've only chosen films that offered me something concrete, even if it is less than what I get to do in the South."
181,Kajol,"In life, I take my decisions and stand by them. Some decisions may have proven to be not the best, but I have learnt from them, and I've never repeated a mistake again. If someone tells me to turn left, I will go right! I could not have been taught a lesson in any other way rather than by going through it.I don't think any actor can be satisfied. I am still in the learning phase and hope I am always in the learning frame of mind in acting or in anything else that I do. That's what makes life interesting and worth living.I feel like I am doing a lot, but if someone asks me what exactly I have accomplished, I don't know... putting my son to sleep, feeding him, taking care of things in the house amount to a lot of work. But, yes, I haven't arrested 14 criminals in one day or saved the world or anything of that sort!Earlier, looking lighter or slimmer never mattered to me. Frankly, I didn't care. I had more important things to do. But when I figured that it's not that hard, and I have the time, passion and patience to take it up, I jumped onto the health-wagon. I started working out.If I like something, I will pick it up from anywhere and wear it. I don't believe that only branded stuff looks good on you. If it doesn't look good in my eyes, I'll never wear it.I spend five times more money at a chemist shop than I would at a fashion boutique. Clothes shopping is optional for me; shopping at a chemist store is a must.I have always been very choosy, but as you grow older, your tolerance for crap becomes less. The role I will do today has to justify the time I take away from my kids and my husband. I love them, spend a lot of time with them and love doing things for them. So to go away for three to six months, I need something equally powerful.My only reason why I am not doing films is my children. My children need my attention, and it's my duty to give them my time. I have not given birth to them to just dump them and go off to work. I am not that kind of a person.I am a very strict mother, and as a mother, it's my responsibility to guide my kids and tell them to go how far and no further. There should be rules and guidelines for the kids, and they should know their limits.I don't really care what other people see me as. I seriously don't. I've always worried about what my opinion of myself is. And I've always thought that it carries most weight. So I don't care what other people's opinion of me is or how they view whatever I've said or done."
182,Kangana Ranaut,"I schooled in Himachal Pradesh. I had taken up science and, initially, wanted to become a doctor. There are few career options for students of science though, so I shifted to Delhi and decided to try theater instead.I come from a middle class family, and my parents weren't too supportive of my career choices.My father is a businessman, and my mother is a schoolteacher.My biggest asset is that I know how to learn, and that, I believe, will help me in the long run.When I left my home to become an actress, my father didn't give me a single penny. I struggled a lot, and they had no idea what I went through. My grandfather even asked me to drop my surname when he learnt I was joining films.My ancestors are Rajputs from Jaipur, a lineage of the royal family.My man has to be more intelligent than I am, which is difficult to find. He should definitely be more successful than me, which is not so difficult to find. I'd be a fool to expect a better looking man than me, which is impossible to find.I cannot approach someone; I lack the confidence when it comes to the guy I desire. I'm very good when it comes to matchmaking and hooking others up. But I can't help my own cause.I come from Surajpur, a valley in Himachal Pradesh near Manali that is named after my great grandfather Sarju Singh Ranaut.Ever since I was a child, I would start crying seeing anyone in pain."
183,Kareena Kapoor Khan,"Life is full of happiness and tears; be strong and have faith.I am not a home breaker and I can never be. I haven't been brought up to create havoc in other people's homes.I do my own thing. And I believe what I do is the right thing.I believe in the institution of marriage and it's like a tag to cement the relationship for your friends, family and public.My professional life has nothing to do with my personal life and vice versa.'Ek Main Aur Ek Tu' was a very special film for me. Imran and we complement each other very well. He is sugar, and I am spice.If I want to kiss, I shall kiss. If I am told that a lovemaking scene is integral to the script, I will consider it.I never really do much research before signing a film. It is just the script and character that I concentrate on.My parents are very modern. My father is a cosmopolitan person. He always supported the fact that I will be an actress. There is nothing else I would do rather than being an actor.I am passionate about acting. 'Girls in our family are not allowed to act' is quite an outdated thought to have. They did it till my mother, but now no more."
184,Karishma Tanna,"Generally, in Gujarati families, people get married early, and all my friends are married with two kids. My father had told me, 'If you do not find a right partner, do not get married'; that's the advice he has always given me. So, I will never compromise in my marriage.I feel every artist has a certain amount of fan following.Even when I was young, with a limited amount of money and exposure, I tried to look my best. I like to follow trends and stand out. I have always had that fashion sense. But with the time, age, money, and experience, I have made a conscious effort to stand out.I thank God because he has given me work somewhere or the other.I like Victoria Beckham's fashion sense. In Bollywood, Kangana Ranaut is really out-of-the-box and quirky.I do feel I have all the qualities of a film star but then why didn't I make it that big? I blame it on my destiny. I was not there at the right place at the right time.I don't regret being on television; I just regret the fact that I wanted to be in the movies, and that didn't happen.Have we ever seen Bollywood stars compete among themselves on a platform like 'Jhalak?' It's always TV stars who compete amongst themselves and are judged by Bollywood stars.I am not a person to compromise on my priorities and family just for a show.I have realised I need to tone down and be easy at times. It is good to be competitive and have a fighting spirit, but one should not go to extremes."
185,Karisma Kapoor,"Maids in India have egos. Big egos. They do not like being spoken to curtly, and they do not like to be abruptly instructed by a woman they do not know. They come with the feeling that they already know everything. So while training them to do things your way, speak gently, and when they do it right, appreciate it.India has progressed to a stage where a divorcee status hardly matters. What matters is that you raise a positive, independent, well-behaved and intelligent child.I don't believe in the no-carb diet... I have a theory. I think if you give up carbs, you get cranky. You must include them in your daily diet.Today what is more important for me is performance. At the risk of sounding immodest, I have done it all - 61 movies over 12 years. But now I am looking for quality. It's easy to be a star. Now I want to be an actress.I am doing what I love; acting is what I love best after being a mother.Acting is like driving; you can never forget it, and it's in my blood.Becoming a mother has been the best experience of my life, and I wouldn't trade it for anything.My daughter is the most normal towards me. For her, I am just her mom. I am just a regular mom, and the actor comes after that. If she likes something that I am wearing, she tells me, and if she doesn't, she still makes it a point to let me know.I won't say I am a strict mother, but discipline is important. Timing and routine are important for kids.I think it is important to be a friend to your kids. But it is also equally important to set boundaries. My mother was a strong influence, and so was my dad. My mom was my friend whom I couldn't cross."
186,Keerthy Suresh,"Whatever big movie I work in, ultimately my concern is my personality. I make sure that I keep it up.My family is very conservative.Someday I will get married, and I should be able to watch my films with my children, mother-in-law, and father-in-law.I have never wanted to leave Malayalam films.I have never behaved like a star kid, and since a lot of people in the Tamil and Malayalam film industries know my parents, they treat me like their own child.I always wanted to be an actress, but my parents were adamant that I complete my studies first before I take up acting.More than comparing with somebody else, I'd prefer comparing my own work from film to film.I believe each actor is versatile and different, so you can't compare them.All I need to worry about is have I done better than my previous film or not.I always wanted to act, but not because my parents were associated with the industry."
187,Kiara Advani,"I think cinema is a reflection of the society and whatever is being shown is because of the climate we're living in. It is relevant, topical, and surely somewhere it's impacting people who can relate to these circumstances.I don't stress about the outcome because I know the only thing I have control over is my own hard work. So long as I'm being honest about that and striving to be the best version of myself, I'm happy.I think the most important thing in life is to be happy. If you're happy, it will show in everything that you do.What I've realised is that I'm happiest when I'm at work, as I am always preparing myself for when the opportunity arises.I took part in plays in school and college, and that is when I realised this is what I wanted to do. My parents told me to finish education and then do what interested me. This is what all parents say, and I am glad that I did that. I took mass media and advertising in under-graduation.People think it is such an easy life, and you just go get ready, and someone does your hair and make up, and all you have to do is say a few dialogues. But there is lot more behind it. You are getting into a particular frame of mind to get into a scene; you have to get your emotion right.For me acting is passion, emotion, and creating the character and the whole world around the character. We enjoy all that. Sleeping on time, eating healthy, you are what your lifestyle is.It is good to have healthy competition and be inspired by others, as all this helps you take up challenging roles. There are people who come from different backgrounds in this industry. In my case, my mom runs a play school, and Dad is into business. When I go home, conversation revolves around that and lot more topics other than cinema.My mom knew Salman sir, as they grew up together in Bandra. He would often tell my mother Genievev Advani how one day he would be a star. They have been friends for the longest time and would go cycling together.I was born and brought up in South Mumbai. My father, Jagdeep, is a businessman and a Sindhi. My mother is half Brit and half Muslim. I am thus a cocktail of mixed blood. From the time I remember, I wanted to be an actress."
188,Kirti Kulhari,"I cleanse and wash my face thoroughly and apply ice before I start applying my makeup.I love pairing evening gowns with hair tied up, like a boho updo or a curly chignon.Olive oil mixed with raw sugar makes for an excellent lip scrub.For the day, keep it simple, basic, minimalistic, natural. Stick to peaches and pinks. For night, you can add colour to your eyes, make them smoky, and also use shimmer and bronzer. Night make up also calls for louder lip colours.Rajasthan is a place I visit very often. My grandparents live in the village called Kulhariyon Ka Baas, and I am originally from Rajasthan.Make-up is an integral part of my lifestyle because of the profession I'm in.I use a water-based cleanser for sensitive skin on a daily basis. This is essential, since I have oily skin.I always use a night eye cream along with a moisturiser for the face depending on the condition of my skin.My make-up routine starts with a primer on clean skin, which gives the face a nice smooth glow.There's beauty in imperfection."
189,Kratika Sengar,"Whatever is shown in a TV show is a reflection of society.I may be smaller in size, but I'm pretty feisty. I don't give up easily once I get started.I am really thankful to everyone around, as Mumbai has given me a lot.When I am not working, I go out on vacations with my family and enjoy a lot.I was doing specialisation in advertising. I had no interest in acting. One of my friends, who was doing specialisation in films, made a short film casting me. Luckily, I got a break, and my acting career took off.'Service Wali Bahu,' like most other serials, cater to women audiences and is aimed at smaller towns where people are home by sunset.If the bond between a husband and his wife is strong, then I think they complete each other, and the relationship also survives longer.I see so many people who are not keen on getting married because they are busy working and doing their own stuff. In fact even I thought I wouldn't get married, but then luckily, I met Nikitin, and everything changed for good.While choosing shows, I look at stories and the concept, and that has to be different.TRP ratings affect me. There are times when the ratings are so low that we feel that we could have done something more. But that is about it. I don't stress over it too much."
190,Kriti Sanon,"I played a tomboy character in 'Dohchay.'The title 'Dohchay' is very perfect for the film. It is used very well in the title track. If you see the film, you will understand it.Sudheer Varma is very easy going and very confident director. He knows exactly what he wants. He has a very good vision and knows how many shots he wants for a scene. He is super fast. He gives freedom for actors to try different things. The atmosphere on the sets was never serious. We had great fun working together.I think every industry is a male-dominated industry. Whether it is Tollywood or Bollywood or India as a whole, it is male-dominated. We stay in India, and it has been patriarchal society.My mom keeps khabar of everything, so I don't feel lonely.I auditioned for quite a lot of films. I do not wish to name the films I auditioned for. There were times when I knew I would not be fit for this film, or I would not get this film. Still, I used to audition for it just to get experience... to practice.If you don't come from film family, it takes time for people to register you. When you don't come from film family, the connection with the audience takes time to build up; it happens eventually.I have been a little lucky to get work. I know there are people who struggle a lot to get a film; I believe a lot in destiny. Things have fallen into place for me.Destiny plays an important part, but talent and hard work is also important.I am sweet and diplomatic in real life."
191,Krystle D'Souza,"Who doesn't wants to be seen on the big screen? But that doesn't mean I will be a part of any project. TV has given me recognition, and I need to live up to the expectation of my audience.I am very clear about keeping my professional and personal lives separate. I don't want to talk about certain things, and that's the way I am.It's nice to know that people are so interested in my life. But I have never shared anything with the media. I like to keep quiet.For my character, I mostly shot in the jungles and also did stunts and fight sequences on the harness. At the end of the day, I used to be hurt and bruised, but I completely enjoyed doing all these.I don't think every relationship needs to be defined.When I was approached to do a digital show where I will be giving away hair and make-up tips, I instantly got excited because that is something I like to do.As a person, I love dressing up. I wear make-up when I am meeting a friend or going for a meeting or even when I am out for a coffee for that matter.One need not spend too much of time and money to look beautiful.When I'm alone, I silently talk to God. Also, at the end of the day, I have conversations with Jesus, where I just talk about my day, my actions and give thanks for the blessings I have received. I do this, as I believe I have a friend in Him.I strongly believe in God. I go to church every Sunday, and if I happen to miss it, then I make up for the loss by going for it during the week. Whenever I spend time in the church, my mind is at peace."
192,Lillete Dubey,"A lot of people in India are not that into non-Indian films or Western films.Everything is possible. Anything is possible at any time and at any time in life. That's such an affirmative kind of feeling.You are not dead until you are in that grave, so don't close the book. Don't give up.The Indian film industry is very, very vibrant. It is a mix like it is in Hollywood - there is a lot of highly commercial cinema.My father was the artistic one. At a very young age, my father realised I had a strong voice and made me learn Hindustani vocal. I was five. I have Dad to thank for introducing me to the finer things in life.I was a rebel. I went to Carmel Convent in Delhi where I was a complete rebel. I thought I was 12 going on 18. I wanted to go out with friends older to me, stay out late - my parents were horrified. It was then that we began having our first disagreements.I believe divinity is within us.India's a fascinating country. It's constantly changing, but there's still a lot of superstition and backwards thinking.Plays which are universal tempt me. 'August: Osage County' is a play which is relevant to the urban Indian set up.All actors know that the real adrenaline rush is in doing theatre. There is an immediate connect, and a role in a play, for an actor, is the biggest temptation."
193,Madhuri Dixit,"I've started doing my Kathak, and I rehearse every day. Also, I'm eating right and keeping in shape. I'm a non-smoker and non-drinker and essentially a happy person. That's what counts the most. Your well-being is reflected in your personality.Mumbai is like Manhattan. There's a certain pace, a social life and the thrill of a professional life.I guess life offers you opportunities to live your dream. We just have to accept what comes our way and live those moments completely. You will not get back this time again, so live every moment you get.A lot of people cannot dance because they are inhibited. 'Oh, I can't dance' or 'I have two left feet' or maybe someone has commented on their dancing a while back. When you enjoy something, you might be doing the simplest of moves, but they still look so beautiful.Dance has always been my passion, and I love it.The film I do doesn't have to be a film that only my kids can watch. My kids will watch films, but I will decide what they watch and not. My aim is to play different characters and not be stuck in a mould. Just because you are a mom and a wife doesn't meant you have to play those roles, even in films.I want to do roles that take women a step farther. I don't want to be slotted into anything. But if I get a brilliant role which requires me to be a mother, then I will do it. But I want people to see that a woman could be anything at whatever age, even if she is married or has two kids.I had never dreamt I'd become an actress. It was destiny that put me in the right place at the right time and gave me the right opportunities.If I see something new, I'd be like, 'Ooh, I want to do that.' The hunger to learn and do better never goes. Your mind is always working. You want to do so many creative things.I don't fear aging. It's natural, and I can't stop it!"
194,Malaika Arora Khan,"Everybody has a role or part to play; if somebody fits the bill, that is what matters.I would love to learn popping, locking and robotics, gymnastics and acrobatics; it is amazing to learn these things.I know basic things about belly dancing, but not the technicalities; I want to learn it. I want to learn belly dancing.As a rule, all relationships go through their ups and downs. It's really about how much you want it.Everyone says romance goes flying out the window when you've been together for an X amount of time. I think it's all up to you.I'm one of the lucky few who never had to face the whole 'Oh, you've had a baby, and now work will have to suffer' bit. It just wasn't a big deal when I got married and had a baby.I'm truly blessed with great genes. I've never done anything drastic in my life, and I can proudly say I haven't tried any of those crazy fad diets, either. I believe in eating right and living healthy. Plus, I love going to the gym, and I enjoy yoga because it streamlines your body.I have always been clear that cinema is not my priority and that my family is.Everybody goes through a phase of fatigue, and I am no different. Re-inventing yourself in your profession is the key to deal with fatigue.Dance and I are synonymous, and nobody can take away dance from my life. Also, I cannot look at dance in an inert way; it's my passion, and I get keen on being part of any show or film that has dance!"
195,Manju Warrier,"After marriage, most women keep aside their aspirations and dreams as their priorities change.Working with Rosshan Andrews has been wonderful.Dance is my passion.I am in love with all the characters I have played. And it is impossible to choose the best.After my 10th standard, my life took me into the world of cinema, but I never severed my ties with my love for reading.I don't plan my roles or my films.My life is studded with a series of coincidences.Women should come forward to protect other woman, as only a woman can understand the problems of another one."
196,Mithila Palkar,"I was 12 when I was on stage for the first time and had an epiphany that this is what I wanted to do.I'm a hopeless romantic and a believer in handwritten letters.I believe, as an actor, I want to tell stories.I get along with people quickly.I was a science student in junior college, but I knew I wouldn't pursue a career in the field.I have grown up watching Marathi plays and craved to be a part of it.Marathi is my mother tongue; there's a certain comfort level speaking in it.If there is something that I want to do, I will definitely try to do it and not just let it go.If a person wants to make it big, they can, and they will! The place that they come from doesn't matter, whether small town or big.Who does not want to work in Bollywood?"
197,Mona Singh,"I definitely want to act, but hosting is something that I am really enjoying. The first show I ever hosted was 'Jhalak Dikhla Ja.' I was super nervous then, but now I am very comfortable.It is just completely disgraceful that someone can go to the extent of morphing my face onto someone else's body to create a sensational video.TV has gone back to basics, relating to middle class family with real characters, less make-up and simple shots. I feel as an actor it is a delight to work in such shows.I'd never imagined I'd become the ambassador of housewives.Men can't bear to see women cry.Actually, my real name is not Mona. It's Jasmeet. I changed it to Mona when I came to Mumbai.In love marriages, you at least know your partner. A known devil is better than an unknown one!It is about time that TV actors were paid as well as film stars.I have never made statements like, 'I'm quitting TV' or 'I'm quitting Bollywood.' I have always wanted to strike a balance between the two.TV actors are doing great in Bollywood. We have our own market, our own fans, who love to see us on the big screen."
198,Mouni Roy,"'Mahadev' got me most recognition. But I have to say that post 'Kyunki'... I was offered everything under the sun. Being an outsider, who didn't have to work too hard, I was overwhelmed.I'm not ambitious; it is clear in my choice of work. I am fine doing a few dance shows in a month to run my household and take care of myself.I don't believe in doing one thing after another. I am a bit lazy, laid back, and a happy-go-lucky person. I don't fret too much. I enjoy living in the moment. If I have too much, then I get confused and distressed.I got roles from good production houses, though I wasn't keen on them, as I was asked to - and I won't - wear a bikini in a film. I'm not conservative, as I'd wear it on holidays, but definitely not in front of the camera. I have to think of my family.For me, all days are memorable days.What people don't realise is that it is the script which plays the most important factor in making or breaking a chemistry.I am a very moody person.I have done a lot of reality shows. In fact,my first show was 'Shava Shava', which was a singing reality show.I have never been stereotyped in one kind of character. I have been a part of reality shows, events, singing and dancing. No one has ever told me, 'She will fit only in this character or this look.' It has never happened to me, luckily.I would be a very sad person if I didn't have dance in my life. However I can, whatever I do, I just feel a lot of joy. Even if I am sad, if you take me to a rehearsal hall, I will automatically become happy."
199,Mrunal Thakur,"I feel immensely proud to be in 'Love Sonia.'I'm glad I got a chance to work with Demi Moore and Mark Duplass. They're so humble and down to earth, and it is overwhelming to share screen space with such mind-boggling actors.Whenever any television actor looks up to me, I say I haven't done anything great; I just followed my dream.My main agenda as an actor is just to spend time with my characters - I am really glad that the roles being offered to me is very versatile.I am taking my whole experience of working in 'Super 30' as fabulous, that a girl who started her career with television got a film like 'Love Sonia' and then could work with a superstar like Hrithik Roshan. I want to value this journey.Ekta Kapoor believed that I would do good work and allowed me to explore. I had that support system.My role in 'Love Sonia' gripped me to the extent that I started despising the male touch. I would stand under the shower for long spells. It just didn't feel nice.I am really fond of drawing, painting mehendi, so I would draw mehendi on a groom's hand and earn money.Working with Hrithik Roshan was amazing. I have learned so much from him.More than the hair and the makeup, what is important is to feel the character."
200,Namrata Shirodkar,"I wouldn't do a lot of the things most actresses do, and that includes my sister.I am more of the disciplinarian and the bad cop at home. Since Mahesh spoils our son, I have to balance it out.I don't plan my life.I enjoy a good movie, no matter what the genre.Mahesh is a hands-on father, though he does not have too much free time because of his work. But whenever we can, we take short breaks and vacations and spend time together.Mahesh and I are very real, simple people.Kids are the most beautiful beings that can come into your life.Mahesh didn't want a working wife; he was clear about that. He wanted time given to him and, later, to the kids.Motherhood is filled with magical little moments that bring you immense joy.People believe Mahesh does what I ask him to. That's not true. He may look shy and gentle, but he knows his mind."
201,Nayanthara,"When I am in a relationship, I give it my 100 per cent. But then, if it doesn't work, you cannot help it. You cannot move ahead with something which isn't working.Anything that you do in life, whether it's work or a relationship or marriage, you get into it with a lot of positivity.Bad things written about me do bother me and affect me, but then I have learnt to take it in my stride. I have also learnt to keep quiet about certain things.When you have to go away from someone you love or vice-versa, whatever the reason, it really shatters your life.I am always open to working with debutant directors, as they bring a new perspective to a script. That motivates me and helps me choose unique scripts."
202,Neena Gupta,"I was offered 'Bigg Boss' twice but I can't do such shows.I watch lots of American shows like 'Desperate Housewives' and so on.Whether I act or direct I ensure that there is a social message attached.I take audience reaction very seriously.Saath Saath' was my first big mistake!I've always decided that I would never be dependant on a man.I can laugh at my own grief.I've realised that nothing that happens is so grim that life can't go on. Life always goes on, no matter what. Even in the grimmest situation, I see hope.I am by and large an honest person, I have nothing to hide.I know I do good work."
203,Neeru Bajwa,"When I started my career on TV, I never knew how my role or character was going to shape up or turn out to be. It was a challenging role for me and I learnt a lot from my senior actors.I was born and brought up in Canada but I always wanted to come to India and act.I have been very fortunate that the Punjabi audience connected with me so well. Otherwise female actors are not repeated much in this industry.I am so honest that at times people get offended by what I say. In our industry, truth is not really appreciated. I love to be of my own. I try spending quality time with my family, my two very close friends and my pet Liam.I mean, it gave me so much popularity, and because of TV, I got my first breakthrough. But I just enjoy doing films more.If I get good films, I would definitely do them. But most of the stuff that I get is not good at all. They were not good scripts.It's been two decades. I feel blessed that I'm still working, and people still want to see me.I'm a believer in arranged marriages. I mean, mine was kind of an arranged marriage. My sister introduced me to my husband. You know, kind of set it up.I am comfortable in my space in Punjabi cinema.Girls and boys also face the societal pressure to get married which I find wrong."
204,Neha Dhupia,"I really got into keeping fit during my Miss India days.People think that just because you're an actress, you have to watch your weight and stay slim. While this is true to some extent, fitness is more about health than looking good.Whether you're an actress or someone who works in a bank, fitness should be one of your priorities.Saying that you're too busy, that there's no time left for a workout is just an excuse - one must make time.Julie' has not been perceived as a sleazy film, and I am grateful for that.I feel for a film to be accepted, women have to take to it. The women bring the rest of the family to the theatres.Before the release, I kept saying 'Julie' isn't for sleazy men only. Thank god the audience agreed with me. Otherwise, I'd have ended up looking silly.I have to watch my moves very carefully because if there are people to support you, there are also those who would like nothing more than to see you fall.In short I love my work.There is a lot I need to thank God for, everyday. But I think I am blessed because I have a very loving, understanding and supporting family."
205,Neha Pendse,"In 'Bigg Boss 12' house one needs to make a mountain out of a molehill. It's an art and I don't specialise in it.You only get disappointed with who you trust the most.If I feel somebody is getting volatile and taking things in other way, I better stay away from that person.I will continue to be good but if people think I don't have a voice and that I don't take stand for myself, that's what I will do. I will show that I have another side to me.We pay a lot of attention to our diet, but never to our mental health.I am not comfortable wearing a bikini in real life, why should I agree to wear one on screen? A swimsuit becomes like a dress when you wrap a sarong over it, so there was no objection to that.I did not want the audience to have the perception that I wore a bikini on screen.People have a certain mindset about me, they know me to be a very serious person as I don't party much nor am I overtly active on social media but there is more to me than what is imbibed in their minds.I come across as a very serious and mature girl but there is also a mad and funny side to me which I hope the house is comfortable enough that it comes out naturally. The thing is this side of me is only known to people I am comfortable with.As a person, I am very unpredictable because I am very moody."
206,Nia Sharma,"I am fine battling lions, tigers, snakes, bulls, even hippopotamuses, but not lizards.After 'Jamai Raja,' I wanted to experiment, hence tried my hands at 'Comedy Nights Bachao Taaza.'It's good to be in the news for whatever reason. I can't pretend that I am not enjoying the attention. Being popular is a good thing.Yes, my fashion sense is outrageous, but I am a rebel. I am young and still growing up.I played a bahu for six years on-screen. I really wanted to come out of that.I don't think I am even that popular. In fact, people must be wondering who the hell Nia Sharma is!Frankly, TV stars are not that popular. In fact, I don't have even have a million followers on any of social media accounts.I am really conscious about what I wear and how I look. I am glad that media has acknowledged this. Over the years, I have really groomed myself.TV stars don't know how to dress up, and they have to hire a stylist. This is true to a great extent. That's why I go out of my way to experiment. Sometimes I hit the bullseye, sometimes I miss.People like my fashion sense a lot, but somehow, I never got a chance to wear stuff that I love on screen."
207,Nikita Dutta,"My poker face makes it difficult for people to figure out what's on my mind.It's better to take the good that comes your way instead of sitting around and waiting.Things for me have quite changed after 'Kabir Singh,' and I am happy with the way things are shaping up.I am excited to be a part of Netflix's 'Maska.' We have a stupendous powerhouse of talent.I didn't do anything productive during my break after 'Dream Girl.' I didn't even take a vacation!In 'Ek Duje'... I play Suman, a girl who runs her own tiffin service in Delhi. She is calm and composed at home but quite bold when it comes to facing the outside world.When a show ends, I need some time to chill, as I feel that I have grown five years older after doing it! I need at least a month to rejuvenate. This happens with Indian TV shows. If you do a show continuously for more than a year, you feel 10 years older.Doing a TV show is like temporarily getting married to it.My idea of chilling is to detox, and after you complete a project, there's so much to unlearn and start afresh.In Mumbai, life is always on the go, but in Delhi, I get a break; it gives me a lot of peace. Here I feel like I am on a pampered holiday, and I am treated like a princess."
208,Nimrat Kaur,"Nothing in my background has anything to do with films. In that sense, I am a complete outsider.My dad was in the Indian Army. He died in a terrorist attack in Kashmir in 1994. After that, my mum and I settled in Noida. I went to Delhi Public School in Noida and then to Shri Ram College of Commerce in Delhi University. It was in college that I realised I wanted to be on the stage and in front of the camera.I have no plan. I will leave it to the good things and good times to find me.I like to be prepared enough to be completely unprepared. I don't know if I make sense, but I have a fantasy of living someone else's life. And to do that perfectly, I need to prepare myself just as properly.Someone very important once told me, 'You can make almost everything look great.' That's the best compliment I have received till date.I opt for clothes that complement my body type. I am not someone who will go for something just because it is trendy and not look good on me. I would choose clothes which are comfortable and accentuate my body type.I am a pretty emotional person. Any act of kindness or unkindness moves me. When I see a romantic couple sitting by the beach, it moves me. I don't break down or crack under pressure, but I am just sensitive.As an actor, there are many confusing factors that can make you take or not take a decision. It becomes difficult. Your first and last checkpoint should be the story. I always read a script as an audience.'The Lunchbox' has been a blessing - all gift-wrapped and tied with a bow. Life is a lunchbox of chocolates now!These are stories you hear... of people sitting in a mall and being spotted, and you think it will happen to you. And when you're fresh off the boat, and new in Bombay, you want those kind of things! They are magical fables. You want to, somewhere, be a part of it, something people will read about. But reality is different."
209,Nithya Menen,"I am not bothered about if my role in a film is small or big. Because if the character I am offered is sensible, I would do it even if it is small.I am not an actress who only wants to do lead roles.I've no apprehensions and inhibitions as an actor.As an actress, I should be able to do all types of roles.I am just an actor, and this is my job. What I am doing is not extraordinary.I don't think I am really awesome. I think I have basic qualification to be an actor.It doesn't feel great to be compared to Genelia or anyone. I don't want to be compared, and I would like to think I am different.Soundarya was always respected, and she is looked at in a certain way that I always would like to be looked upon as an actress.Acting is emotionally draining, so I make it a point to not do anything when I am home.Acting was never planned."
210,Nushrat Bharucha,"I do have my cheat days, but I prefer to follow this vegan diet because it keeps my body and mind both happy.It's a fight for every actor to surpass what they have done in their previous film, especially when it is accepted hugely.Everyone loved 'Pyaar Ka Punchnama,' and it appealed to a mass.If the packaging is good - the actors, director and producer - then it will work, even if the product is not good.I knew people would see 'PKP.' Although the packaging was weak, the product was good.This whole concept of basket chaat is so unique, and it is really yummy!Frankly speaking, during the making of 'Sonu Ke Titu Ki Sweety,' we never realised that the movie is going to be such a hit and that it will change our lives so much. There have been movies which have done really well at the box office, but rarely do we have movies where actors get so much love and adulation from their fans.The audience's reaction is the most rewarding thing for an actor, especially me.I want to actually date someone who is not from this industry.I don't know how to swim."
211,Parineeti Chopra,"I don't think I have a genre at all.I'm just trying to do all kinds of films.It's an honour for me to work with Rohit Shetty. He is the biggest commercial director of the country, making the biggest franchise, 'Golmaal.'We are what we are because of the people in our lives. What would I be without my family and close friends?I count the weeks and days before my birthday.If someone close to me forgets my birthday, I am heartbroken.I am not one of those actresses who says she has no time for love.This 'bubbly' word, I am personally going to take it up as an agenda to ban it. Colas are bubbly. Champagne is bubbly. I am not bubbly!I think directors look at me because I am an energetic person with a strong personality and always like to make people laugh.I am a responsible person. I plan a lot. I am disciplined."
212,Parvathy,"If I am going to be phased out by whatever powers, then I want people to know that it is not because I am bad at my work.My career strategy has never been the most important thing; my conscience is.Even with me, there are so many things I have bottled up.I am not the kind of person who shouts out.Bollywood marketing is larger-than-life. Honestly, it amuses me.Everybody has a priority. Mine is simple and clean acting, and my work, irrespective of the industry I am in, will not cater to anything else.I have been in the industry for 11 years but still feel excited about my work. That is what keeps any actor going.There is casting couch in the Malayalam industry.Sameera, my character in 'Take Off,' was extremely intense.As an artist, my only relationship to my audience is through my work. That relationship is sacred to me."
213,Persis Khambatta,"Basically, they had asked me if I would shave my head or wear a bald cap. I said look, if you are doing a series for five years I would want to shave my hair because I would go bald with all the gum and glue from the bald cap.Besides, a bald cap would have never looked real.I was thrilled, because I like the big screen and I could then move on to the next thing. It was the biggest break for me. In a way, though, I wish it had been a TV series because then you are working for five years.I also had this artist friend who'd paint butterflies and things like that on my head.Maybe I'm being philosophical and spiritual, but I believe that if you put negative energy out there that that is what will come back.Creative people are very insecure people because they don't know whether people like them or are in awe of them. That insecurity always comes out. It makes them a better actor, I feel.I mean, every Star Trek episode you saw was just phenomenal.Gene Roddenberry was a genius.I arrived in Hollywood and lived much of my life in America, but the fans did not really know me.I only went to one Star Trek convention and that was in the late '80s. I hadn't gone to a convention before that. It was quite amusing, with the people dressed up and all of that."
214,Pratyusha Banerjee,"I liked models since I was 3 years old. As I grew older, I started developing a penchant towards makeup, pedicures, etc. I used to carry out the procedures at my home itself.I quit 'Jhalak' for 'Balika Vadhu.' I suffered from dengue; I was in ICU for three days, and then I quit 'Balika Vadhu.' I needed a change and wanted to experience new things.I connect with very few close friends in real life.I'd rather not think about the unpleasant side of the experience. 'Bigg Boss' is the biggest reality-show in India and perhaps in the world. I went into it on a clean slate.My family supports me, since they trust me not to do anything wrong.People are bound to comment, and that means they are following me.Everybody thinks you're wrong and that you're a kid, and hence, you should shut up. Such reactions hurt me. I can think for myself.Just because people are older, they don't have the right to tell you what's right and wrong.I wanted to show the world the real Pratyusha.I love TV and am happy doing TV shows."
215,Preity Zinta,"In my career as an actress, I have never got involved with anybody from the world of films. I have always kept my professional and personal life separate, as that's my policy.I've learnt that there's a soul mate somewhere in this world. Till you don't find that person, the search goes on.What I've learnt is never to work with the person you are in a relationship with because sometimes you need a break.I've never cheated or been cheated upon. I've seen my parents together and secure. So I feel the same way. Infidelity stems from low self-esteem. You want to cheat when you don't feel good about yourself.If women want to be treated equally, then they can't ask for sops and whine about not being treated equally. All I'll say is no guts, no glory for men or women.I feel really humbled because I decided to go on Twitter, and all of my fans on Twitter say one thing consistently every single day, and that is, 'When are you coming back in movies?' I didn't even think people missed me that much.I moved to cricket at a time when I was at the peak of my career, and I can guarantee you that no one else from Bollywood would have done that.If some actress thinks she is sexy and she can dance, it's her choice. I do what I want to do, and I set my own benchmark. I will never compare myself with anyone.Two things in India are religion - one is cricket, and one is movies - these are two things.In the end of the day, you are human. Film is a job which is not an individual job; you have tons and tons of people behind you - you have a whole crew of people working. But, an actor is the face of a film, so you get all of the good things, but you get the bad things, also."
216,Priyanka Chopra,"I live cinema and passionately love music, and my efforts in both these crafts are unfolding.I got into the movies by accident. When I got an offer, I thought, 'Let's try this, too.' Everything in my life has happened by trial and error. I didn't even think I would win the Miss India title, so where's the question of thinking I'd come this far.I adore watching movies; movie marathons are my favorite pastime. I can watch up to five movies back to back. I also love music and like reading whenever I get the time.I believe destiny and hard work go hand in hand. I was studying to be an engineer when my mom and my brother sent my pictures for the Miss India contest. I didn't even know about it. If that isn't destiny, what is?I don't come from a film background. I haven't learned anything about films or film-making. But I have a thirst to know everything about my profession. I want to learn about cinematography, about editing, about music recordings, about post-production. So when people in the know talk, I willingly listen.I have a very eclectic taste when it comes to music.If two of your films don't do well, people say you're out in the cold and your career is over. One film does well, and you've had the best year of your life! I don't believe in all that's written.As a musician, I know that it'll take time for me to get to the ranks of an established artiste. Nevertheless, I'm very happy that people are appreciating my music.As a girl, I am this stupid, emotional, very loyal, sort of believe-in-values-and-principals sort of girl.There are cliques in Bollywood, and people stick together, but I have always tried to stick to my work. As an industry, Bollywood is very competitive, and I'm very competitive as a person, but I've never been a part of any clique, and I've always worked with all actors and directors, all camps."
217,Raashi Khanna,"Initially, when you start working out, it takes at least six months for the results to show.I have always taken it very easy, believed in myself. Whatever I bring to the table, I put my heart and soul into it.I would love to work with everyone, but I am not desperate. Things will happen eventually.I struggled a bit with Malayalam, but it was easier speaking Tamil; it is closer to Telugu.I think for a heroine to do comedy and action and also be glamorous is a big thing. That's why 'Supreme' will be very close to my heart.I didn't overcome my shyness. I am still shy.There is nothing like getting a performance-oriented role.I don't think I was bubbly in 'Oohalu Gusagusalade.' It was a real character.I am a complete sucker for family time.My Hyderabad home is an extension to my family's Delhi residence."
218,Radha Ravi,"There is nothing wrong with Radha Ravi calling women to his office. There's nothing wrong if a man calls women to his office. There is something wrong if a man calls men to his office.I've been a character artiste for four decades, and in our job, we learn very early that it doesn't pay to be narcissistic.Good looks may be enough for a heroine, but to become an artiste, you need at least a working knowledge of the language.Maybe actors are more passionate about cinema than actresses. Many heroines today seem unable to look beyond glamour.Item song dancers like Silk Smitha and Jayamalini have become irrelevant. The heroines are doing those dances themselves.When I'm given a role, I'm consumed by a passion to bring to life a character that exists only on paper. I mull over the character for days and internalise his feelings.It doesn't matter if I have experienced actors alongside or novices. It doesn't matter if the director is one film old or a hundred. All I'm interested in is doing justice to the role.It's a pity I have been stereotyped as a villain.When a director narrates a character, I find it normal to ask questions about the character's background, mood swings, eccentricities, behaviour... I do this to make my performance relatable. Directors who don't know their characters well find it difficult to answer these questions and, hence, find me annoying.None who has passed through the portals of UAA has been a failure. From the former Chief Minister, Jayalalithaa, to Lakshmi, Cho, Nagesh, Moulee, Srikanth, ARS and I, all have been a part of UAA."
219,Radhika Apte,"When in doubt, always wear black.Look after all those lovely peculiarities in your face, your body, and yourself.I'm friends with all my contemporaries.We have so many male superstars, but there are just a few female actors who have attained that status. It is not only because of the industry; it's in the society.I think if a Swiss watch can come to the country and have their own corporate stores, a Pakistani actor should come here and do a film here in India.If you are an industry kid, the first film is given to you on a platter. However, the pressure and expectations are immense.There is no set way of getting a role - you don't give an exam, score well, and then nail a film.Though I have achieved a little bit in my career, I have to continue working hard.The image of an actor plays a huge role in deciding if he or she can experiment with roles.It's not just about looking shocked if the scene demands it. It's about feeling that emotion. You can't lie to the camera, because it captures everything. This is what I have learnt over the years."
220,Radhika Pandit,"The first time I ever attended a Varamahalakshmi puje was when I was introduced by Yash to his family and kind of made it official that we are in a relationship.For me, summer holidays, vacations, New Year, and any trip away from Bengaluru meant going to Goa. My mother is from there.There is pressure from day one when you start your career.I've always striven to ensure that I work on one film at a time.While I don't claim that I feel no pressure, I have strived to take up only those scripts that appeal to me. I've been lucky that the ones I chose were also liked by audiences.Getting the right script that will work at the BO and relate to the audience is what matters. You also need a great director to bring the script to the screen in a form you envisioned it to be.All of us are in search of something or the other, be it dreams or success.All the projects that I am part of get delayed for reasons beyond my control!'Adhoori' and 'Sagar' took a long time to complete.An award, to me, means a bonus. It's not that an actor works for an award. I don't work for an award. But, when you get an award, it is encouraging and inspiring and reminds you that you need to do well."
221,Rakul Preet Singh,"Reviewers are entitled to say if they liked the screenplay, performance, and execution of a film or not. But when they say things like the film doesn't cater to a certain audience, it leaves people wondering if they should watch it.Everyone gets a raise when they do well. No one asked me what I got for my initial films. There was a time I got paid Rs. 6 lakh. I charge what producers are willing to pay me.In 10 months, I was replaced from three films. That's when I realised I need to take my work seriously. It's a blessing I didn't get things easy. If I had, I wouldn't realise the value of success.Speaking in broken Telugu is one thing, and dubbing is another.A lot of hard work goes into making a film. It's not all fun time, as people tend to think. There are always stereotypes attached to every profession, but I found out this industry breaks them all.A newcomer needs to be careful as to what kind of role they choose. If you choose something different, you will end up getting typecast. That's why I chose to play a character my age, to keep my options open for the future.Hindi film and southern film industries are doing well when it comes to technical know how. By and large, they are pretty similar and are close knit industries.Before I came to Bollywood, lot of people told me that here things are not very professional, but I've had no such experience.If I wasn't an actress, I'd never wear make up. I liked being ready in half an hour and arrive on the sets. Even for a no-makeup look, if one has a dark under-eye on a particular day, a little makeup is used. I had no scope for that as well.I've seen 'Legend'. I like a different kind of cinema, but when done with conviction, anything looks good."
222,Rani Mukerji,"I think there is a lot of space for people to love who they love, and a lot of space for actors to carve a niche for themselves.Though I technically come from a film family, my father had stopped making films even before my brother and I were born. So I did not really grow up in a filmi environment. And when I was growing up, becoming an actress was still quite a taboo. And you may not believe this, but even my father did not want me to join films.My understanding of films was just as much as any young girl who watches Bollywood films. I had no idea about the whole process of filmmaking, about dialogue writing, scripts, screenplay etc. I had probably gone to two or three film shoots in my childhood.When I plan to settle down, I will announce it to the world. Marriage is an occasion to celebrate. I'll celebrate it when it happens, letting everyone know about it.People miss those who they love. It brings tears to my eyes to see the longing for me. But it's my decision to do fewer films and more protagonist-based roles. For me to take up something, it has to make a lot of sense to me.Not all offers I get are exciting and inspiring. I would rather sit at home and not work than jump into mediocrity for the sake of just moving ahead. If it's a good script, I would sacrifice my personal time and grab it.When I turned 30, I realised the value of time and with it, the other important things in life. That's when I did up my house, started spending time with my family and friends and did all that a normal girl would do. All these things I was balancing with my work.A filmmaker chooses an actress keeping the best interest of the film in mind. If he doesn't cast you, it doesn't mean there's a personal agenda. Change is constant, and if you have agreed to be part of this industry, you will have to go with the change. The films and filmmakers, even the audience has changed.Every actor is alive because of his/her fans. I'm glad that my fans love me so much. I have an immense responsibility towards them. That's why I'm careful while signing a film. What is also important is to judge whether I would like to watch the film as an audience or not.You work with some people, you see a spark in them and you can't help praising them. But everyone has their own destiny. No one can make anyone. Who reaches where and when, is all written."
223,Rashami Desai,"People pass a lot of judgment about each other in India, and that is a tendency I don't like.As a person I don't judge others because I have no idea what circumstances they are in.The rumours and link-ups with my co-stars are upsetting. Is it a crime to be a divorcee and a single woman? Does being a divorcee mean you can't have a life?If I go out with my girlfriends, no one has an issue, but if I put up a post with a male friend or I'm seen chatting with a co-star, there is unnecessary speculation. What wrong am I doing that I'm being treated this way?I am scared of stepping out of the house, because of what people will think of me. In our society, men and women are looked at differently anyway, and that's even truer if you are an actress.Being a divorcee and single is very tough for me.My relationship was always abusive, so I chose to not socialise much. People who knew me knew that what pain I was going through.I am not getting married on a show.I know how to cook, so working in the kitchen will never be an issue.I have no qualms sharing my stuff with others. Whether it is a bed or any other stuff."
224,Rasika Dugal,"Filmmaking, it has been my first love.There’s a difference betw­een being a star and an actor. If you feed off from being in the public eye, this is the unfortunate flipside to it.It is exciting to see the different genres that audiences want to watch. The response to a show like 'Mirzapur' last year and to Delhi Crime earlier this year was so encouraging and a proof that good content is the new formula.I am enjoying the abundance and variety of work on the web.Infidelity is a fairly common occurrence in society but very often not spoken about.The kind of scripts I have read for web shows have been outstanding.I have also done a web show called 'Delhi Police'. It is about the investigation around the Nirbhaya case. It is also very path-breaking and interesting.But, as an actor, the role that I enjoyed, in terms of really understanding and appreciating this profession, was Anoop Singh’s 'Qissa'.The problem is never the audience, it has always been the distribution. The digital space is proof that the audience is quite accepting.Because I feel as actors we are required to be vulnerable, it is a part of our job. So the space that you are being vulnerable in should respect that, otherwise it is not worth it."
225,Raveena Tandon,"I never did my eyebrows in most of my early films.I have always said what is in my heart.In 'Maatr,' we do not justify taking the law into our hands. That's not the right thing to do. We are not promoting that.I have stood on my own feet.I have never been scared, and people know that.I feel bad when my film flops.I have been to Kargil, and I have seen the tragedy that both the Indians and the Pakistanis faced.A female celebrity just has to chat and smile with a guy for him to become the new man in her life. Amazing.The fact is many of these guys whom I was supposed to be seeing are my buddies. I've always been the bum chum kinda girl.I'm on backslapping terms with everyone from Sanjay Dutt to Sanjay Kapoor. That's why wives never feel threatened by my presence in their husband's lives. They know if I'm their husband's friend, I'm the wife's buddy as well."
226,Ritika Singh,"I never wanted to be an actress. I am a martial arts fighter.I have done 'Shivalinga' because I liked the story. My character, especially, is very impressive.Compared to boxing, acting is more difficult. I have learnt martial arts and boxing since childhood. So, they were easier.I am very happy to have debuted in Telugu with a film like 'Guru.'My main goal for taking up acting as a profession was to show that sport or MMA teaches you life skills that can be applied to any profession in the world.I began fighting to stay fit and experience everything equally; hence, I took up kickboxing.Whenever I go to any particular event, people are shocked that I'm a fighter. To be a fighter, I have to look a certain way, and to be an actress, I have to look a certain way. I have to change that; I've joined acting to do meaningful cinema and to show that there is much more than glamour that actresses can offer.Sport has taught me never to be jealous of someone or insecure if somebody is doing well. It's taught me teamwork and the value of patience. Even If I lose, I know that I've actually not lost.I never thought of acting Bollywood. I have not seen many films.I was crazy about martial arts. At the age of three, I started training in karate."
227,Roop Durgapal,"Zumba is so energising and refreshing. It's totally fun. My face turns red at the end of the session, and I feel like I am ready to take over the world.I was pushed into Zumba by one of the trainers in my gym. He saw me looking inside the Zumba room, so he told me to just go and start.I would love to do a love story or a socially relevant drama. Something on the lines of Netflix originals. I would love to explore the big screen, too.I have several Gujarati friends in Mumbai, and I keep eating from their tiffin boxes whenever we meet. I love Gujarati food!I love the affection that people in Gujarat shower artists with.The best part about reality shows is that they make you a well known name.It was nice working with a jolly team in 'Gangaa.' I was well-acquainted with the production team, which was same on 'Balika Vadhu.'If something is done without objectifying, it can be beautiful.I had water phobia since childhood without any reason as such.I am not in the favour of a girl running after a guy. My traditional thinking is that a guy should pursue first. Personally, also, I would never run after a guy."
228,Roopa Ganguly,"I think it is very difficult for a man to accept a celebrity as his wife. One has to be extremely emancipated to do it. No Indian male is.I never accepted any invitation which came only in my name. I never took any calls before 9am and after 10pm. As soon as my shoot would wrap up, I used to head home without even removing my make-up. I did everything that a girl should to keep her man happy.My marriage was always my first priority. I had left my career to go and settle with Dhrubo in Kolkata. I have never behaved like a celebrity at home.Pray for me, I need happiness in life. It was a very tough decision to leave my husband and son and come away to Mumbai and start all over again.I still feel the affection of the fans that I get because of my acting career.I want to build the India that we all want.I have always worked with utmost care. I have given my 25 years. I seemed I have more to offer than just acting. So, there is no regret.I have always been brazen. That's why I can't tolerate corruption.Even before I became an artiste, when I barely had the means to support anyone financially, I took care of several destitute women, giving them shelter, food and clothing.I have seen poverty first hand. My parents were not well-off. They were in Ban'gladesh and I - just a child then - was sent off to live in my uncle's house in Calcutta."
229,Sai Pallavi,"I always wanted to create awareness and spread the word that it is important to respect one's own body and work towards its well-being.When I am in India, I feel pampered. However, when I am In Georgia, I am on my own, as I have to cook and do things all by myself. However, that gives me an independent feeling.I believe if you are destined to do something, things will definitely happen.Since my childhood, I used to tell my parents to keep a tab on their health as if I was a doctor. Now I am officially one, and I hope my parents will finally take me seriously!I love dancing, and I dance for my own happiness.I've turned down a few roles because I couldn't see myself in them.When you work with someone like Dulquer Salmaan, you tend to get a bit intimidated.I have never used makeup in my life. I'm not fond of it at all. I love myself the way I am, and I try my best not to use it - the only things I use are sun screen and eyeliner.I drank tea for the first time during the shoot of 'Premam.'I find happiness in the tiniest things."
230,Sakshi Tanwar,"I think I've become the brand ambassador of arranged marriages, especially for working Indian women.I'm not desperately looking for a man, but I'm sure one of these days, I'll find my Mr. Right.I have been fortunate to experience a wide range of characters. What more can an actor ask for?When a product is made, everyone hopes for the best. Whether it could have been better or not is more of an afterthought.I haven't thought about getting into production. I'm interested in the creative aspect of storytelling.I've always wanted to take up work that my heart is convinced about. And I shall continue to do so.I feel birth, death, marriage is destined, and these things can't be manipulated. I have surrendered my life completely. So, whenever it happens, I will accept it.There is no guarantee what will give you happiness any which way. I know many married people who are unhappy."
231,Samantha Akkineni,"I know many actresses who started big but were sent packing, as they couldn't sustain the momentum. I am in this for the long haul.I have always wanted to work with Lingusamy, as he is a master of commercial cinema. I have always admired his etching of female characters.People often ask me why I don't take up more heroine-oriented roles. My question is, 'Where are these roles?' I really appreciate actresses who sign only films with meaty roles. However, there aren't too many of them. The industry is simply male-dominated.I think people are able to relate to my appearance. They think of me as the girl next door.I am done with the cliched heroine roles. I can't go to work without a challenge. I want to do films that drive me, films in which I am a part of the main plot.I am my biggest critic. Even in films where people said they liked me, I have disliked myself.There's a thin line between catering to the masses and making a fool of yourself; I try to walk that line.There are thousands of good-looking women out there. Longevity for a heroine doesn't come only with good looks: talent matters.Only the film industry can make you an overnight success. Unlike other jobs where you have to work your way up, here you can reach dizzying heights of fame instantly.In the film industry, you are fictitious, just like the characters you play. It has a lot do with a perception about you, and not necessarily you. You are successful because people like that image of you on screen."
232,Sangeetha Krish,"I just did what the script demanded from me in 'Uyir.' I felt it was indeed a challenging role for me.I shy away from doing heroine-dominated subjects.Once 'Uyir' created a controversy, I had several offers coming my way with prominence to my character. However, I avoided them purposefully.Acting in a heroine-oriented film is a tough job.Dhanam' is one of the interesting scripts that I came across. It centers around me.I am very choosy and keen to do good roles.When I did 'Uyir,' I initially feared to do it. It was a controversial role. But thanks to my friends, they motivated me and helped me come out with aplomb.I thank my directors who keep faith in my acting credentials and give me roles like I did in 'Uyir' and 'Dhanam.'Much prior to my marriage, I loved donning homely-girl roles and perhaps now I can tread taking up best of that sort.I have proved my skills as an actress who can perform both character and glamour roles and 'Uyir' would take me to greater heights."
233,Sanjeeda Sheikh,"Understanding between a couple is the most important thing, rest everything follows.Marriage will be happy and blissful if you understand and support each other well.Love is out of this world feeling; nothing is as pure as love.DDLJ' - it's an out an out love story and one can relate to it. It's one of the best movies I have ever seen.I wasn't expecting a proposal from Aamir that night, especially when he had waited long hours for my shoot to get over and I too was drained after giving back-to-back scenes that involved portraying a lot of mental traumas and crying. As I came out of my shot, he stood in front of me, went down on his knees and proposed marriage.Aamir and I are still boyfriend-girlfriend. The other day we were discussing how we don't feel like husband-wife; however, the only thing that has changed after my wedding is that I get to meet my guy every day.I want to be choosy, because one has to invest a lot of time in TV shows.Television made me who I am.I felt people wouldn't be enticed by the web, but I was wrong. I too don't watch TV anymore, and only watch digital shows.The digital platform has its own viewership, but we have a lot of people who still watch saas-bahu shows. That is not going to change."
234,Sharmila Tagore,"I was very close to Mani Rabadi. She not only designed my clothes in some of my films, she was also a personal friend and guide when I was new to Mumbai.I worked with three designers in my heydays - Bhanu Aathiya, Shalini Shah and Mani Rabadi. Out of these, Mani was the least assertive and aggressive. I remember Bhanu used to be quite insistent and particular about her fees etc whereas Mani was too soft-spoken.Aradhana' was a very big hit while 'Avishkaar' is a cult film.Well, a daughter is someone you've grown up with, right? So you know her temperament, you know what makes her angry and how to deal with that person. You're meeting your daughter-in-law when she is an adult already and you don't quite know what her temperament is like, so it takes time to gel.I am a Bengali, I like my rice.I think it's quite a big decision for women to have children. In our time, I don't think we thought so much about it. We just went and had them and of course, life is not fun-filled and not complete if you don't have them. It's a wonderful thing when you think about it.I felt so much closer to my mother after I had babies. It bonds a mother and daughter more.I remember when Saif was a baby, the pediatrician had recommended that we give him orange juice to drink, but my mother said he was too small to be able to digest it and that I should dilute it with some water. I didn't listen and Saif had a tummy-ache. I guess mothers do sometimes know best and it's also the experience that counts.In my time, Mother's Day wasn't celebrated the way it is now. In fact, there used to be no Mother's Day for a long time.There's nothing like young children's energy... They are always curious, and enthusiastic about many different things."
235,Shefali Zariwala,"When 'Kaanta Laga' was offered to me, I was in college, doing my engineering course. I did the shooting of the song for some pocket money. I never imagined it to become such a huge hit.I am a very straight forward, no-nonsense woman.To cope with today's competition, you need to do whatever you want but with passion, confidence and attitude to match.Initially I used to find it very awkward when people used to turn back and stare, but now I am used to it and love all the attention.I believe every actor is trying to create an identity for himself or herself. My first song did that for me. There can be no other 'Kaanta laga' girl… ever. And I love that.My life has been nothing short of a fairy tale.When 'Baby Come Naa' was offered to me, I found the script so mind-blowing that I had to gather the courage to perform or it would have been completely my loss.Dancing has always been my comfort zone.My parents never leave me alone.We have to be responsible towards the environment when we celebrate our festivals."
236,Shilpa Shetty,"I try to be a good daughter, as I believe in karma and feel that how you are with your parents is directly proportionate to what you receive in your life. I am a big oneness follower, and our gurus have told us that if you want to achieve external happiness, you need to be happy internally. And your inner circle is your family.Not coming from a film background, be it a teeny-weeny role or a big role, I have done it with a lot of dignity and fought my way through. But the only thing that kept me going is that I am the sort of person who doesn't take no for an answer. If someone rejects me, I will be out to prove that person wrong in my own way.I like being innocent, but know now when I am being taken for a ride.If a guy wants to take me out, he must seek my dad's permission first. That's just the way it works.Yes, many people in rural parts of India are very orthodox and have arranged marriages. But I won't - I want to fall madly in love with someone and be whisked off my feet.I don't want to go into a marriage just because of my age - too many people make that mistake. But of course I'd like to be married one day - I dream of having children because I adore kids so, so much.OK, I'm not what you'd call 'wild.' But I'm no prude, either - I love to party, and I play a mean game of pool.I need someone to woo me. Magazines are always saying I am beautiful and millions of men want to woo me, but none has come forward because they are all so scared.I'm eulogised by a lot of men, but they wouldn't take me home to meet their mothers.If you saw me without concealer, you would see that I have raccoon eyes. And I think my forehead is too small. I am not quintessentially beautiful. I am photogenic, but that's only because I have learned how to make the best of what I've got from the make-up artists I have worked with."
237,Shilpa Shinde,"This is not a filmy line, but truth always wins.I have never hurt anyone, and that pays back. I have always wanted good for everyone.No artist from my industry has ever supported me, but all technicians have been on my side.It's not easy to cook for 20 people.I do not wish to work in the TV industry anymore.I am always confident that I am a good person.My confidence to win 'Bigg Boss' did not come from the number of fans I had before entering the house.I would rather explore the medium of films than television.I have been through so much.Let me tell you, everyone has different experiences. I had a lot of things going on, and I am dealing with it in my own way."
238,Shraddha Kapoor,"My style statement is to be myself! Because if you try to imitate someone else, you will end up feeling uncomfortable.I completely agree that a sound sleep is the best beauty product. Sound sleep, one of the most important but underrated thing, helps to make you more beautiful. I can never understand how people work so hard that they miss out on their sleep.I think broccoli is one of the must-have foods, as it contains multi nutrients and is high in vitamin C. Sweet potatoes are rich in complex carbohydrates, and fish, too, is healthy. There is nothing that I have on a daily basis, as it becomes monotonous.I use the products I endorse. For instance, I always carry the new Lakme Lip Love that I launched, and if you come home, there is one on my bedside table, too.When you know someone, and you get to work with them, automatically there is this comfort zone which comes in.Intimate scenes or a kiss is a very technical aspect of filmmaking. It is extremely mechanical.I always wanted to do something different with each film. So I guess that means that I wanted to not repeat myself. There has to be some kind of a new element in each project that I take up.I wasn't a friendly child. I was reserved and mostly kept to myself. My family tells me they've noticed a sea change in me after I've grown up. But I guess that's natural. Your surroundings, friends, college, etc. do make a lot of difference to your personality.Now I am also friendly with people who are not so nice to me. From what I've learnt, it's nice to be friendly. It's nice to make people feel good about themselves.I used to trust people easily, but now I'm a little careful because some experiences have taught me to not trust anyone blindly."
239,Shraddha Srinath,"I did realise that when you talk with a straight face, you come across as someone bolder than somebody who bats her eyelids a lot.I learnt that an actor should be willing to take risks, try new things and unlearn stuff.The West has a better understanding of what the word sexual abuse or harassment means. There are some concepts that they understand way better.'Richie' was my first Tamil audition and first Tamil film.I feel if I'm playing an athlete, I know I have to prepare. I need to get that body language right, I need to walk like an athlete, look like an athlete. If I'm playing a musician, I need to know how to play an instrument.I know it wasn't like a meteoric rise, it was not overnight success. Nobody watched my movie, fell in love and said 'I'm her biggest fan.' People took time to warm up to me.I personally believe that I'm a very unconventional heroine. And for me to be cast in some very nice films and whatever little name I have made for myself, I feel proud of myself.Telugu is a lot like Kannada, so I don't have a problem with Telugu. But Tamil is very difficult to learn, man.I'll be honest, acting in a commercial film has its perks - crazy stardom, crazy money and frequent trips abroad - but why would I aspire for something I'm not cut out for?A lot would change if laws were strictly enforced. I know it's a medieval thought, but fear is what keeps us from doing wrong things, right?"
240,Shriya Pilgaonkar,"I am a Kathak dancer, and have got an advanced diploma in it.I never think in terms of better or worse, I believe there are many ways to get to where you want to be.My criteria for choosing a film are first the story and the team that I'm working with.I am not very strategic by nature.I have always loved languages, I have studied basic French and Japanese too.My instinct and gut guide me very strongly.I want to be part of projects where I can showcase my growth as an actor.We need to realise that not everyone can take the path to overnight success. Take actors such as Rajkummar Rao and Vicky Kaushal - they have built their work and profile over the years to get to where they are.The most important thing is to be steady and consistent.I am not at all in a rush to make a career that only lasts for a short span of time."
241,Shruti Haasan,"When I was a musician, I had no intention of taking up acting.I am a musician who started acting.I am happy wherever I get success.This may sound strange, but I did not join the film industry to be a star and be successful.The first and foremost criterion for me when selecting a film is the character I am playing, and then the director.I don't believe in method acting.I really believe in trying to fulfil what my director wants, what I can do to make that scene better.It's always lovely to know new languages.I liked the original 'Dabangg.' I've always felt 'Dabangg' was like a South Indian film.Though the characters I have played are all very different, they are all strong, interesting women."
242,Shweta Tripathi,"As an artist, when you make something, you want the world to see it in its totality, especially when the intention is not to titillate.Acting is a psychological profession, and every character drains you emotionally, regardless of whether it is an intense art house movie or a light-hearted commercial series.People often say that they want to move away to smaller cities for a better lifestyle and peace, but as a single girl, you need your society, your neighbour, and even passersby to give you some respect.A lot of people are shocked when they hear that I played a 14-year-old.I love mid-length skirts, especially for the times when I've not waxed.Like most Dilliwalas, I'm an ace at bargaining. I have spent hours doing that at Janpath and Sarojini Market.I don't care for brands. I'm more of a boutique shopper because the things I will find there are unique, and there won't be any copies.I shop a lot from the children's section and, sometimes, from the men's section. You'll find skirts, shirts and shoes from the children's section. My friends buy me more adult-like clothes, and I love those. But I cannot do away with the colourful stuff.A lot of people think that, as a person, Nawazuddin Siddiqui is very serious. However, he is very funny and witty. Once he opens up with you, he can be the funniest person around.I loved 'La La Land.' I would love to do a film like 'La La Land' which has so much simplicity and joy of cinema in it."
243,Sobhita Dhulipala,"I am lucky to have found an artistic companion in Anurag; there is a sense of belonging.I was 19 or 20 when I won Miss India and then did some exciting work in fashion.I moved to Mumbai to pursue my degree after high school.I watch a lot of Malayalam films and admire them greatly. The films have such wonderful content.I learnt a hard fact: that dignity is a luxury in our country.If I choose to be part of stupid films, I don't deserve to call myself an actress.I didn't grow up watching films, as I was more academically inclined.Before starring in 'Raman Raghav 2.0,' I must have watched only 20-odd movies, out of which eight were part of the 'Harry Potter' series.I like reading and writing, and I am a trained classical dancer.I want to tell stories that I feel for, and I don't want to be a sell-out."
244,Soha Ali Khan,"I have always felt the only reason to get married is to have children.There is no perfect relationship. You have to work around the dissatisfaction.My mother is a very liberal wife and mother, so there was no peer pressure to marry.I've always felt when you are committed in a relationship, you have to work through the difficult times.I can not cook and come back at late hours after work.A non-fussy home delivery of chicken biryani at 3 A.M., absolutely makes my day.It may sound funny to others, but there is a sense of freedom when I am able to live on my own, and as per my own set standards.I love my family for who they are.I have always loved acting.I hate confrontations."
245,Sonakshi Sinha,"I believe one doesn't have to shed clothes to look sexy!The audience for 'Lootera' is far less than for my other kind of films. Just because I pulled it off doesn't mean I will change my tastes. I love to watch masala films, and I love to sing, dance and say those larger-than-life dialogues. But whenever I get a chance, and I really feel the connect, I will do a performance-oriented film.I never did films for the money or because I needed to buy a house or car. I do it because I love my job.Hits and flops will come and go. But what stays with you is the experience you had while shooting a film. I am happy learning something new each time.I don't know what I am doing tomorrow. But I know one thing for sure: the day I stop enjoying my work, I will pack up and leave.I've done two remakes, 'Rowdy Rathore' and 'Son of Sardaar,' and I see nothing wrong with it. The originals were in a language that not everyone understands, so when you're making it in another language, you can reach a much wider audience. That's how I look at it.My opinion is that you cannot really blame cinema for the result of what is somebody's mindset. I think it's just entertainment. For me, I've always believed in doing things that I can sit and watch with my family. So far I think I've stuck to that, and I will also in the future.I don't pick my roles based on what clothes I have to wear. I pick roles because of the character I have to portray, and the public have enjoyed seeing me in those roles.Salman Khan is the best co-star that I could have ever started off with. He's very supportive, very chilled out and very nice to work with, so working with him was a great start to my career.I didn't intend to even become an actor. I was studying fashion, and I think acting just happened by chance. It really felt more like I was watching a movie from outside, like it was happening to someone else. It's been a great journey so far."
246,Sonali Bendre,"I land in New York, and next day, we go to the doctor. He looks at everything, and we had sent all our tests, and he says, 'You know, it is fourth stage, and you have 30% chance of survival.'Every time I feel fearful of something now, I do it.I came from a very middle class Maharashtrian family. It was a big step to get into movies. My family was shocked.Every cancer is different. The symptoms and treatments are different, and every human body deals with it differently. There are no formulas to it. That, I think, was the biggest takeaway for me.I have endorsed every hair product in my career. Looks have been my bread, butter, jam. Looks are important in our society.I am a completely self-made person. It's been a tough journey - I learnt on the job, worked 48 hours without sleeping.There's a hidden Goth in me: I have a dark sense of humour; I have a dark sense of fashion.My routine is very simple because I realised that the more complicated the exercise sessions are, the less likely I am to make it for them. They have to be simple and doable in my daily routine.I read anything and everything. Comfort food for my brain is fantasy fiction or science fiction.When I shaved my hair, my friends asked me to keep it, maybe make my own wig out of it, but I wanted the old hair to go; it was not mine. I wanted to let go."
247,Sonam Kapoor,"I am very ambitious and have set goals for myself. I really don't keep a tab on what my contemporaries are doing. I want to push myself as an actress and don't want to get into the rat race. With every film, I want to grow as a person and an actress. The character I play needs to change me in real life.I am very romantic. Given a choice, I'd do only romantic films!I don't care about controversies. I am a young woman with an opinion about certain things. I can't be diplomatic. I am a feminist, and as long as I can be the voice of hundreds of girls out there, I will speak my mind. I don't care what other people think.I love eating. Unfortunately, I have to be really determined and control my foodie temptations. That is the only thing I don't like about being an actress; the constant need to check my weight. Otherwise, I love my job!As actors, we want to choose somebody who has conflicts. I can't be always playing the girl next door. What's the challenge in that?One needs to constantly read up, practice and work, irrespective of your profession. If I feel as an actor that I know everything, then how will I to grow? How will I improve? I'll be stuck in a rut, and eventually I'll grow complacent.When I get into relationships, I'm an all-or-nothing person. I just completely give in to the person. It becomes my first priority in life; family, friends and career follow.I'm the worst liar in the world.I've battled my weight since I was 12. My parents took to us to New York once, for a holiday, and there I'd buy fruit loops from a 24x7 shop and sit down with my books. I never played; I wasn't that kind of kid - I just read. I ate chocolates like peanuts. I was 86kg till I was 19.Indian junk food is my sin, even though I pretend to like Japanese."
248,Sowcar Janaki,"This MeToo is bothering me much, making me shun TV and newspapers. They are making such wild charges for cheap publicity, claiming something happened longtime back, or perhaps did not happen, or perhaps could have happened.Cinema brings together people from all walks of life. It connects everybody. It's an art in motion.The country's image has improved ten-fold during Vajpayee's prime ministership.Comedy now is all about body shaming and delivering vulgar dialogues. There can't be another Manorama.What can I say? I was there at the right place and with the right people. My theatre background helped a lot in shaping my comic streak.I am thankful to get a role at the age of 81.I may not have made humongous sum of money through acting, but I have enough to lead a stress free life.My sister was the glamourous one and her movies portrayed her beauty and glamour. As a person, she has enormous patience and has single-handedly supported my mother and my siblings. I have always admired her loyalty to the family.As a kid I loved to listen to the radio, later I became a radio artiste and would listen to the BBC.I was born after my dad came back from England and he wanted to raise us like European kids."
249,Sridevi,"It is a heartening experience to know that you are loved and being missed.I have always believed that your face is a mirror to your nature.What you feel inside reflects on your face. So be happy and positive all the time.In the '80s, the brand-endorsement market was quite nascent.Jewelery is my weakness. Whenever I see any jewellery, I am unable to control myself. My daughters or somebody has to cool me down.I am a big fan of Meryl Streep.I have never planned my career. I chose those films with which I could relate myself. But if given a chance, I would love to do the kind of roles Meryl Streep has done.Audiences want to watch heroine-oriented films, and even writers are writing scripts for women. I am very happy to see this change.Being a mother is the most beautiful thing happened to me. I am enjoying every bit of it.I lived my 'Mom' character. I became Devaki."
250,Sriti Jha,"My audition for 'Dhoom Machale Dhoom' was the turning point of my life.I'm part of a great job where I get paid to learn. My first brush with the world of showbiz happened when I got selected while I auditioned for 'Dhoom Machao Dhoom' at my college in Delhi.I really don't have any struggle story to tell about my stint in Tellytown.I hail from a small town. My parents were never apprehensive about my decision to take up acting - they've been a constant support to me.I don't think I'm popular enough for audience to relate to me on a reality shows. I'm content with my acting endeavors and want to continue taking up more of acting projects.We breathe life into a role, and it's overwhelming to receive positive feedback.My life is not as dramatic as it is depicted in the shows. I am not at all submissive. I am free-spirited.'Balika Vadhu' happened to me because I worked hard in my earlier shows. So, in a way, they are responsible for building my identity.Despite our hard work and the number of hours we put in, content is the hero of every show.I don't regret my decision that I left a popular show like 'Balika Vadhu.' I am happy that I am out of the show and took a break for a month in Delhi."
251,Sumalatha,"I am not a professional politician.If I want to enter politics, it will be only from Mandya. Otherwise, I will be totally away from politics as it is not my ambition at all.I am not going to pretend I will change the landscape of Mandya in one day.My first campaign message is: You can fight an election with clean and healthy methods without resorting to dirty tricks and cheap talk. This is my first agenda.I can assure people of Mandya that I will be an efficient voice of the district. Farm distress is a cause of concern and I want to fight it.I hate the word 'politician' in connection with me as I do not see myself as one.I was quite good academically. My uncles wanted me to go for the civil services.In 1981 I had 21 releases so you can imagine. I was doing three shifts. It was chaotic. I was in the studio or airports. The quality did suffer along with appearance but we didn't pause to think.Congress leaders did not exert pressure on me to contest from Bengaluru South. But I told them categorically that there is no question of contesting from any other constituency except Mandya because of the bonding my family has with the people.I consider it is my duty and responsibility to protect the interests of Congress workers and leaders in Mandya, and I reiterate that I will contest from Mandya on the Congress ticket and there will be no change in the decision."
252,Sushmita Sen,"I will definitely get married, but it is not that it has to happen at a certain age.When you have love in your life and respect what you do, you get up and do things. Yes, definitely I do feel tired, but when I look around and see how privileged I am, I get going.People who try to tackle failure attract failure. The more you indulge in analysis, it gets tougher. So just keep making mistakes and learn.Life comes as a full circle. It feels good when you become someone's idol.'Sholay' can be given so many interpretations. I have seen this film so many times since the time I was a kid that I think that there could be 50 lovely interpretations to this film. Different filmmakers can give it so many interpretations, as it's a lovely film.I have this very simple logic about life that it should not be taken too seriously.RGV, as a filmmaker, is very smart.There is a very pensive and intense side to me that even I did not know someone could capture.I Am She is an institution that reflects and personifies the grace, charm, and elegance of an Indian woman.I don't believe what I do outside my profession is anybody's' business. And that includes a personal thing like pregnancy or even marriage."
253,Swara Bhaskar,"I was an avid 'Chitrahaar' and 'Superhit Muqqabala' watcher. We did not have cable TV for a long time, so that was my only source of entertainment growing up. My great fantasy was to be in 'Chitrahaar!'My parents are very democratic and liberal people who made the mistake of being democratic and liberal in the upbringing of their children! And in my case, they are still paying for it! Paying in the literal sense as well.Mumbai is a spider web. You do a film and make 10 connections and do something else and make 10 more connections. You keep moving like that.I'm an actor, and I don't judge my parts.I'm a typical Delhi girl. Professional parents, nuclear family. My father was in the navy. I've spent my whole life in government accommodation, and it's been lovely.When I grew up, I realised what an amazing thing my parents did. It was such a big deal for my mom, a middle class woman, to decide to leave her children and husband to go and do her Ph.D. for three years. And my dad, who is even more middle class, a traditional South Indian, to let his wife do that.I was an avid reader as a child. I am losing that habit now, as my brain congeals into cabbage from wearing too many heels and too much foundation.Politics should come from human stories.I feel glamour has a legit place on the ramp and in the fashion world. In films, glamour has to service the story.I feel that where I came from made me the actor that I am, and I wouldn't want to trade that with anything else."
254,Taapsee Pannu,"I never regret or sit back and think that I shouldn't have said something. There are a lot of people who tell me that you shouldn't say this or that or should keep quiet, and I really think that I can either be true to my conscience or can live a fake life by staying quiet.It's very claustrophobic to live a life which is not really how you wanted to live. You are forcing yourself to be quiet and behave like someone you are not.I don't believe in poking nose in other people's matters, but when it comes to matters related to me or something that affects me, I will not shy away for saying something I believe.Either I choose to behave or live a life of someone else, or I choose to be myself and live the life the way I want.I think being strong is something that resonates with my personality. It's on my face.I'm very good at manipulation.I keep saying this: that I'll get married when I am ready to have a kid. I won't have a kid without getting married for sure.You can make me work for 14 hours at a stretch, but don't make me sit.It helps me rejuvenate when I use my energy in different directions and then come back to acting.Maintaining pay parity is very important, and I am in total favour of it."
255,Tabu,"Whether the film is a Hindi film or in a South Indian language, I don't think it matters.I think every actor worth his or her salt wants to do good, meaningful cinema.Since I am originally from Hyderabad, I speak Telugu fluently.I am keen on doing the regular Hindi film, but I want strong, meaningful roles in my repertoire, which I get down South. I can devote equal time and attention to both, so I don't see the clash.As a viewer, I will go and watch only commercial films.I grew up in the seventies, and films for us were larger-than-life, masala entertainers.I do a film because I would love to be a part of it, but I also think from the audience's perspective. Our profession survives because of our audience.Films like 'Shaan,' 'Sholay,' 'Muqaddar Ka Sikander' and so many others... they've been a part of my growing up years.'Cheeni Kum' was one of the nicest experiences.I had read Jhumpa Lahiri's 'Namesake' and thought it would make a fabulous film, as I could identify with the central character. When Mira Nair announced the film, I wanted to do the role. When it fell into my lap, I was over the moon."
256,Tamannaah,"I have changed a lot as a person coming into showbiz and meeting a cross section of people from all walks of life; it was an amazing experience. But that's the privilege I had of being early into showbiz.As a kid, I wanted to be an actress, but ambition and reality are two different things.My college life was brief because I started working for my debut film when I was in eleventh standard. But I have no regrets, as I stayed in touch with my friends who keep briefing me about the drama in the college. The opportunity to get into showbiz was so exciting that I couldn't let it pass by.I think 'Happy Days' was huge and an unexpected high point of my career. I was a newcomer at that time, and I was fortunate to get such a role in the film. 'Paiyya' was another highpoint, as it opened up Kollywood for me.Humshakals totally exist. In fact, I was on one of these social networking websites, and I noticed that there is this entire research done on Hollywood celebrities who look like each other.I think all of us have enemies in disguise, but there is nothing much you can do about that. You have to live with it. I just do my own thing and let the enemies be.Making a mark becomes more challenging when you are a part of a multi-starrer. But I like that.Even if one is not a great actor, just being in front of the camera requires a lot of effort.It was never a conscious decision to stay away from Telugu cinema.I say yes to a film depending on who is directing it."
257,Tena Desae,"I work out for an hour and a half every day, alternating between cardio and weights. I also do yoga for an hour every alternate day and swim every other day.I keep my beauty regimen as natural as possible. I wash my face four times a day. In the beginning of the day, I use an exfoliating cleanser made of besan, turmeric and sandalwood. I drink lots of water and avoid oily food. I use only The Body Shop products on my face, as they use the least amount of chemicals.My role models are Madhuri Dixit and Kajol. Both actresses have done a wide variety of roles. That is something I wish to do. On the other hand, I also want to be like a Hugh Jackman or an Angelina Jolie because of the lives they have outside movies. Because of the kind of balance they strike between their work and life outside of it.My style statement is fun and flirty. My wardrobe must-haves are a good dress that can be styled differently, a good pair of jeans, and a few nice tops.I will definitely continue to do Bollywood because that is my thing and I can't not do it - I have to do the singing and the dancing because it is so much fun. But I would like to explore my opportunities in the West, so we will have to wait and see.I love Victoria Secret!Everyone goes on about how Bombay is so similar to New York, so I had see what the big deal was. The bustling crowds are the same, but it's a lot quieter, it's a lot cleaner, and it's not humid. I think the energy is very similar to Bombay.I think 'Slumdog' was probably the first big film that happened in India, but even that seemed like a one-off thing.I don't plan, because everything goes against my plans anyways. There's absolutely no point in planning anything. I'm just enjoying the moment. I'm meeting with a whole lot of people - casting directors, directors, agents. I have things going on everywhere, but I have no solid plans.Why should I have to say bye to one thing to do another? I can do lots of things at one time, and as much as I love to do films, I'd love to do ads as well!"
258,Tina Ambani,"The most delightful aspect about the language of cinema is that it speaks to each of us in different ways - it is a purely subjective experience.I believe change is the only constant in life, and there is a place and time for everything.I was the youngest of nine siblings... I lost my father when I was just 13. For me, the elders have been my gods.I don't believe in themes.I may be boring, but that's okay; I don't want to hard-sell myself.There was a time when I could only relate to happy works. With time, my taste has evolved.I was never meant to sit at home.In the role of Miss Munim, I had credibility as an individual."
259,Upasana Singh,"So many comedy shows came and went but it was 'The Kapil Sharma' Show that excelled.I don't want to be a part of a show that is creatively dissatisfying.Actually, you have to spend a lot of time on TV. So I have taken a break from TV and shifted my focus in the movies.I was very happy working in 'Comedy Nights' with Kapil.I always loved watching 'Nach Baliye.' I was even supposed to participate in it but it didn't happen for some reasons. But I am excited to host it.I am a trained classical dancer.I love dancing.When you are doing comedy, you need to get the right reaction from your partner.I wouldn't want anything on my personal life making its way into the public domain.I don't depend on 'The Kapil Sharma' Show for my living."
260,Urmila Matondkar,"I don't like cooking and don't cook until I am forced to. Then I expect everyone around to appreciate what I dish out.I thrive on cheese and champagne.I like seafood like prawns and fish - I can live on prawns!I am not fond of red meat.Just because of 'Rangeela' and 'Daud,' it can't be said that I am a sex symbol.'Rangeela' was a very wonderful film, a great experience.'Rangeela' and 'Daud' are both exciting films. The songs, the music, the dances - they all blend so well.'Masoom' was like a picnic for all of us. We kids just wanted to have fun acting in the film. We never realised when the film was completed. When we did, we realised the party was over.There's a lot of scope for performing in masala movies.As you grow older, maturity naturally comes to you. And it shows on your face. It's true not only about looks, but your maturity should also reflect in your performances."
261,Urvashi Rautela,"The best part about being in the 'showbiz' industry is that you can voice your opinion.For me, a sexy man has three very important qualities: a great sense of humour, intelligence, and loyalty.I don't really pay a lot of attention to trolls.I choose to focus on my work so that I can turn my dreams into reality.Since childhood, I have wanted to become Miss Universe India, and I did. I am so grateful to God for that.I love acting.I have a very schoolish approach to acting. I like to do my homework, know more about the character, and study it. It's all about the craft.I tell everything to my parents.Being a model and an actress, I feel we a have a responsibility towards society.I think imparting sex education to children is important."
262,Vaani Kapoor,"I'm happy that my parents were supportive. They never really pressurised me into going ahead with just about anything.I don't stay in the constant worried and over-thinking zone.I hope people like me in the film and love the film because I think 'Befikre' is a very sweet film.I don't think 'Befikre' is frivolous at all. Yes, the film is light-hearted. Shyra and Dharam are free-spirited but that doesn't mean they are obnoxious.Yes, I come from a protective family.

I am not the best person to break the ice."
263,Vidya Balan,"I was a happy person before marriage. I'm definitely happier after marriage.I take one day at a time. I am not someone to define my goals.Promotions can be seen in two ways - either you hate them, and they're a burden, and you are getting through with it, or you can enjoy them. I decided early on that I was going to enjoy them. I did 43 interviews in a day for 'Kahaani.'The stakes are high on every film now because there's the opening weekend. The first week is extremely crucial; increasingly, films are being judged in terms of opening day, opening weekend, then first week. People are going berserk promoting their films.Marriage is something I'd recommend everyone to try, if you find the right person, of course.I'm someone who believes in 'live and let live,' and that applies to everything.I don't think my competition is with the heroes. I don't think I'm competing with anyone. I don't mean to sound Zen, but genuinely, when I stopped competing with anything is when I started enjoying my work, and that brought out the best in me. I'm living in a universe of my own, and I'm enjoying that. I love to appreciate other people's work.A painter once told me that I'm like the Khajuraho, which you see once but which remains with you forever. I thought that was exquisite.Cinema is about people, and we are a very emotional people. That is why you see those ups and those downs and those colours. That is what Indian cinema is about.I enjoy the sari. I think it's the sexiest garment ever. It shows you the right amount, it covers the right amount, it's extremely versatile, it suits every body type, it suits every face."
264,Vijayashanti,"The movie 'Kallukkul Eeram' ensured that people noticed me; there was no looking back.Anything I do, from movies to politics, I ensure that I observe, learn and give it my all.My father passed away when I was 17. I had no one to take care of me.I'm destiny's child. I've enjoyed every minute of my life, all the twists and turns. They have made me who I am.People should elect those leaders who have their ears to the ground.The Cabinet led by KCR had no place for a single woman.When an actor charges high fees, nobody says anything. But when an actress does the same, it becomes news.Once the Congress party comes to power under Rahul Gandhi ji's leadership, we will enact a strong law to prevent horse-trading and defections.After listening to the script of 'Sarileru Neekevvaru,' I felt it was an apt film for me to re-enter films.Directors have to come forward and give women a chance to show their potential; they have to create more lady superstars."
265,Yami Gautam,"'Sanam Re' is an amalgamation of an emotional love story and a visual treat.I take full pride in the fact that I'm from Chandigarh.When I get to work with someone like Prabhu Dheva at the beginning on my career, why would I say no?I'm the only one responsible for the choices I make and the opportunities I get. When you read the script, you don't know how it's going to shape up. You just know what you've been narrated.I'm not a gadget freak.I'm there on all the social networking sites, as it plays an important role.We travel a lot and don't get enough time to spend with our family, and so we have to take our pictures, videos, also bother about things like which are the HD quality phones. So I'm very much a part of these typical things.For fitness, I've just bought a watch which keeps a track of how many calories I burn, what's my heart rate, which is very fascinating.Even though 'Vicky Donor' was a huge success, I have had one or two films which have not done well, but that's all right.There is failure in every industry; there is failure in every step. It's just that we are working in an industry where everything is just out there; that is why it looks so magnified. But failure is a part of life."
